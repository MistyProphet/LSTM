[[zeus]] took the skies, [[poseidon]] took the seas, and [[hades]] was left with the [[greek underworld|underworld]] upon being tricked by zeus. the gods created the mortals, whose faith and prayers fueled the gods' immortality. as time passed, however, mortals began to question and soon resist their creators, angering the olympians.a fisherman named spyros finds a coffin adrift in the sea, discovering a baby, [[perseus]] and his mother [[dana\xc3\xab]]. spyros and his wife, marmara, raise [[perseus]] as their own son, alongside their daughter, tekla.  as [[perseus]] and his family fish from a boat, they watch soldiers from the city of argos destroy a statue of zeus. infuriated at this desecration, the gods unleash the [[erinyes|furies]] who attack the soldiers and destroy the fishing vessel. only perseus survives and is found by a group of the soldiers.perseus is brought before king [[cepheus, king of aethiopia|cepheus]] and queen [[cassiopeia (mythology)|cassiopeia]], who are celebrating their campaign against the gods. queen cassiopeia brashly compares her daughter [[andromeda (mythology)|andromeda]] to the gods and boasts that she is more beautiful than [[aphrodite]]. the revelry is cut short by the arrival of hades, who has been given leave by zeus to punish the mortals for their defiance. hades threatens to unleash his monster the [[kraken]] against argos, unless andromeda is offered as a sacrifice. before leaving, he reveals that perseus is a [[demigod]] and the son of zeus.perseus meets [[io (mythology)|io]], who confirms his origin. io also reveals that she has watched over perseus his entire life. she has always protected him for he is the only one who can defeat the gods.perseus leads the king's guard to the [[graeae|stygian witches]], looking for a way to kill the kraken. after being betrayed by the power-hungry hades, zeus gives perseus a sword forged on mount olympus and a winged horse named [[pegasus]]. perseus refuses both, but the captain of the king's guard named draco keeps the sword for when perseus needs it. soon after, they are attacked by calibos, an agent of hades. draco severs the beast's hand and calibos flees. the band give chase but are attacked by giant [[scorpion]]s called scorpioxs that spring from spilled drops of calibos's blood. they are saved by a band of [[jinn|djinn]], non-human desert sorcerers led by sheik suleiman where the remaining scorpioxs are tamed by the djinn. the djinn also wish for the gods' defeat and lend their aid to perseus and his band.the group arrives at the lair of the stygian witches and learn that to kill the kraken, they must obtain and use the head of [[medusa]], a [[gorgon]] who resides in a temple in the underworld. any living creature that looks on medusa's eyes turns into stone.perseus, io, suleiman, draco, and his remaining men, solon, eusebios, and ixas, cross into the underworld. the men enter medusa's temple lair while io, being a woman and forbidden from entering, remains outside. medusa kills all three of draco's men. suleiman and draco both wound the gorgon, sacrificing themselves in the process. perseus finally beheads her by using his reflective shield to see her with his back turned. as he leaves the temple with medusa's head, calibos appears behind io and fatally stabs her. perseus and calibos fight where upon finally accepting that he is a son of zeus, perseus picks up the olympian sword and stabs calibos through the chest, who with his last breath urges perseus not to become a god.before dying, io urges a reluctant perseus to leave her and save andromeda and argos. then she dissolves into a golden ethereal vapor. pegasus appears and perseus mounts the flying horse and hastens back to argos as the kraken is released. the people of argos seize and bind andromeda to offer her to the kraken. meanwhile, as people die in the kraken's wake, the balance of power on [[mount olympus|olympus]] shifts. hades reveals he does not require the faith or worship of mortals (as zeus does), as he has learned to survive on their fear. hades then effortlessly subdues the weakened zeus.riding the black pegasus, perseus arrives at argos and exposes medusa's head to the kraken, which makes eye contact just before it is able to reach andromeda. the kraken, petrified, slowly turns to stone and shatters. prokopion, the insane leader of the cult of hades, tries to kill perseus, but cepheus stops him and is stabbed, before both are killed when the kraken's petrified hand falls on them. hades appears, intending to finally kill perseus. perseus, calling upon zeus, throws his sword at hades. a lightning bolt engulfs the sword and the blast sends hades back to the underworld.perseus rescues andromeda, who is now the rightful queen of argos. andromeda asks perseus to stay by her side as king, but he declines. perseus also refuses another offer of godhood from zeus, who then proclaims that if perseus is to live as a human he should not be alone and revives io."

aS"the film is based on the true story of betty anne waters, a single mother who works tirelessly to free her wrongfully convicted brother, kenny. the story unfolds in flashbacks, and the film opens with the scene of the brutal 1980 murder of katharina brow in [[ayer, massachusetts]]. in many ways, betty anne's life revolves around her brother, who is now in jail for the murder. despite kenny's knack for getting in trouble, they have always been close. after the murder, kenny is initially brought in for questioning by sergeant nancy taylor ([[melissa leo]]), but released. two years later, based on new testimony from two witnesses, kenny is arrested and tried. the evidence presented at kenny's trial is entirely circumstantial, but he is convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. the three main witnesses against him are taylor, his ex-wife, brenda ([[clea duvall]]), and an ex-girlfriend, roseanna ([[juliette lewis]]).three years later, betty anne lives with her husband, rick ([[loren dean]]) and two sons, richard and ben. she is frantic that she has not heard from kenny, who calls her every week from prison, and finally discovers that he tried to commit suicide. betty anne decides to go back to school and become a lawyer so she can exonerate him, but her husband is skeptical and unsupportive, and eventually they split up. as betty anne struggles with being a working mother attending law school, flashbacks reveal that her mother was callous and uncaring, forcing kenny and betty anne to fend for themselves. the two were very close, but frequently got into trouble, and were eventually taken away from their mother and sent to separate foster homes.betty anne continues to visit kenny in prison, working in a bar while going to school, but her busy schedule causes her to miss a planned outing with her sons, who decide they would be better off living with their father. struggling in school, demoralized and exhausted, betty anne stops going to classes, until a friend from school, abra ([[minnie driver]]), comes to her house and prods her to just get up, get dressed, and get back to class.in a study group, betty anne learns about the new field of dna testing and realizes that this could be the key to overturning kenny's conviction, as only blood types had been matched at the time of the trial. she contacts attorney [[barry scheck]] from the [[innocence project]]. the backlog of cases will mean waiting more than a year unless she can pass the [[bar exam]] and find the blood evidence from kenny's trial herself to have it tested. at first she is stonewalled, then told the evidence was destroyed, but she refuses to give up, and she and abra embark on an odyssey to recover any evidence that might still be stored away somewhere. in the process, betty anne learns that nancy taylor was fired from the police department for fabricating evidence in another case, which deepens betty anne's suspicions about kenny's conviction and the evidence presented at trial. finally the dna results come back and establish that the blood was not kenny's. betty anne and kenny are overjoyed anticipating his release, but [[martha coakley]], of the district attorney's office, refuses to vacate the conviction, claiming that there was still enough evidence to convict kenny as an accomplice. kenny is convinced that no matter what, the authorities will find a way to keep him in prison to avoid admitting their mistake. betty anne is heartbroken but again refuses to give up.betty anne, abra, and barry scheck visit the other two trial witnesses, kenny's ex-wife and his ex-girlfriend. both tearfully confess that sergeant nancy taylor coerced and threatened them into perjuring themselves at kenny's trial. with an affidavit from kenny's ex-wife and the dna evidence, kenny's conviction is vacated and he is freed from prison after 18 years in june 2001. betty anne is able to persuade his daughter, mandy ([[ari graynor]]), whom he hadn't had any contact with since she was a small child, that he never stopped trying to reach out to her while he was in prison despite his ex-wife's efforts to estrange them. he is able to reconnect with his daughter, and is reunited with his sister and her sons.the epilogue states that betty anne secured a large civil settlement from the city of ayer for kenny's wrongful conviction eight years later, but former sergeant nancy taylor was immune from the crime because the massachusetts statute of limitations had expired. katharina brow's real murderer has not been found."

aS'on [[2003 invasion of iraq|march 19, 2003]], iraqi general mohammed al-rawi ([[yigal naor]]) flees his residence amid the bombardment of baghdad. before leaving the compound, he passes a notebook to his aide seyyed, instructing him to warn his officers to get to their safehouses and wait for his signal.four weeks later, [[united states army|u.s. army]] [[warrant officer (united states)|chief warrant officer]] roy miller ([[matt damon]]) and his platoon check a warehouse for [[iraq and weapons of mass destruction|iraqi weapons of mass destruction]]. to miller\'s surprise, the warehouse has not been secured, with looters making their way in and out, as soldiers from the [[101st airborne division]] are too few to do much. after a firefight with a sniper, miller finds that the warehouse is empty, the third consecutive time he has found nothing. later, at a debriefing, miller brings up the point that the majority of the [[intelligence (information gathering)|intel]] given to him is inaccurate and anonymous. high-ranking officials quickly dismiss his concerns. afterward, cia agent martin brown ([[brendan gleeson]]) tells him that the next place he is to search was inspected by a un team two months before and that it too has been confirmed empty.meanwhile, pentagon official clark poundstone ([[greg kinnear]]) welcomes returning iraqi exile politician ahmed zubaidi (raad rawi) at the airport. there poundstone is questioned by \'\'wall street journal\'\' reporter lawrie dayne ([[amy ryan]]). she says she needs to speak directly to "magellan", but poundstone brushes her off.meanwhile, while checking another unpromising site, miller is approached by an iraqi who calls himself "freddy" ([[khalid abdalla]]). freddy tells him that he saw some [[ba\'ath party]] vips meeting in a nearby home. they include al-rawi and his officers and aides in baghdad, who are discussing the current situation. al-rawi decides to wait for the americans to offer him a deal, and attack if they don\'t. as the meeting ends, miller and his men burst into the house. al-rawi narrowly escapes, but seyyed is captured. before miller can extract much information, seyyed is taken away by [[joint special operations command|special operations]] personnel - however, miller keeps al-rawi\'s notebook. dayne complains to poundstone again, but he states that the stakes are much larger than her role in selling newspapers.miller goes to brown\'s hotel room in the green zone, where he tells him what happened and gives him the notebook. brown arranges for miller to get into the prison where seyyed is being interrogated. miller is then approached by dayne, who questions him about the false reports of wmds. miller bluffs his way in to see seyyed. near death after being tortured, he tells miller that they "did everything you asked us to in the meeting." when miller asks what meeting he is talking about, he says one word: "jordan." miller then confronts dayne about the bogus intel she published, but she refuses to identify magellan, her source. after miller tells her he suspects that al-rawi is magellan, dayne reluctantly confirms that magellan met with a high-ranking official in february in jordan.miller realizes that poundstone\'s men are hunting al-rawi, and can think of only one reason: al-rawi confirmed there was no iraqi wmd program and is now a major liability. poundstone confiscates the notebook from martin; it contains the locations of al-rawi\'s [[safe house]]s. when miller tries to arrange a meeting with al-rawi, he is abducted by al-rawi\'s men following poundstone\'s announcement of the [[coalition provisional authority order number 2|decision to disband the entire iraqi army]]. al-rawi tells miller that he informed poundstone that the wmd program had been dismantled after the [[gulf war|first persian gulf war]]; poundstone, however, reported that al-rawi had confirmed there were wmds so the us government would have an excuse to invade. poundstone\'s men attack the locations listed in the notebook. when they get to the general\'s hiding place, he flees, ordering one man to kill miller. miller manages to kill his captor and races after al-rawi. miller finally captures al-rawi, but freddy suddenly appears and shoots the general, stating that the fate of iraq is "not his to decide." with his only witness against poundstone now dead, miller tells freddy to flee. later, miller writes a scathing report. he confronts poundstone in a meeting and gives him the report, but poundstone dismisses it, telling miller that wmds do not matter. poundstone then rejoins the meeting, only to see iraqi factional leaders reject zubaidi, the us\'s choice as leader of iraq, as an american puppet and storm out. afterwards, dayne receives miller\'s report by email. the recipient list includes reporters for major news agencies around the world.'

however, ivan has made peace with his. before leaving he tells roger that he knew  all along that he had instituted something roger never brought up. having had a similar experience he laments he could have helped him and in disgust says that they never talk about anything good or meaningful.dejected, roger ends up calling florence's phone and leaving her a long voice mail where he confesses that he really likes her.the next day, roger's niece invites him to australia, and he jumps at the invitation. he convinces the neighbors in the pool to take care of mahler, but on the way to the airport, he changes his mind. instead, he goes to pick up florence at the hospital, and they return to her apartment. the film closes as she listens to roger's voice mail."

yusuf ([[dileep rao]]), a chemist who concocts a powerful [[sedative]] for a stable "[[false awakening|dream within a dream]]" strategy, ariadne ([[ellen page]]), an architecture student tasked with designing the [[labyrinth]] of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of cobb\'s father-in-law, professor stephen miles ([[michael caine]]). while dream-sharing with cobb, ariadne learns his subconscious houses an invasive projection of his late wife mal ([[marion cotillard]]).when the elder fischer dies in sydney, robert fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight back to los angeles, which the team (including saito, who wants to verify their success) uses as an opportunity to sedate and take fischer into a shared dream. at each dream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a "[[hypnic jerk|kick]]" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level; to be successful, these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level, a fact complicated due to the nature of time which proceeds much faster in each successive level.the first level is yusuf\'s dream of a rainy los angeles. the team abducts fischer, but they are attacked by armed projections from fischer\'s subconscious, which has been trained to defend against extraction. the team takes fischer and a wounded saito to a warehouse, where cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake saito up, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into "[[limbo#cultural references|limbo]]", a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is difficult and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream. despite these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.eames impersonates fischer\'s godfather, peter browning ([[tom berenger]]), to suggest fischer reconsider his father\'s will. yusuf drives the van as the other dreamers are sedated into the second level.in the second level, a hotel dreamed by arthur, cobb convinces fischer that he has been kidnapped by browning and cobb is his subconscious protector. cobb persuades him to go down another level to explore browning\'s subconscious (in reality, it is a ruse to enter fischer\'s).the third level is a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by eames. the team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as cobb takes fischer into the equivalent of his subconscious.yusuf, under pursuit by fischer\'s projections in the first level, deliberately drives off a bridge and initiates his kick too soon. this removes the gravity of arthur\'s level, forcing him to improvise a new kick that will synchronize with the van hitting the water, and causes an avalanche in eames\' level. mal\'s projection emerges and kills fischer, cobb kills mal, and saito succumbs to his wounds; all three fall into limbo. while eames sets up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives, cobb and ariadne enter limbo to rescue fischer and saito.cobb reveals to ariadne that he and mal went to limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology. sedated for a few hours of real time, they spent fifty years in dream time constructing a world from their shared memories. when mal refused to return to reality, cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem (an object dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality) and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real. however, when she woke up, mal was still convinced that she was dreaming. in an attempt to "wake up" for real, mal committed suicide and framed cobb for her death to force him to do the same. facing a murder charge, cobb fled the u.s., leaving his children in the care of professor miles.through his confession, cobb makes peace with his guilt over mal\'s death. ariadne kills mal\'s projection and wakes fischer up with a kick. revived at the mountain fortress, fischer enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. while cobb remains in limbo to search for saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. cobb eventually finds an aged saito in limbo and reminds him of their agreement. the dreamers all awaken on the plane and saito makes a phone call.upon arrival at los angeles airport, cobb passes the u.s. immigration checkpoint and professor miles accompanies him to his home. cobb tests reality using his totem, a spinning top that spins indefinitely in a dream world, but ignores its result and instead joins his children in the garden.<ref>{{cite web|first=charlie jane|last=anders|authorlink=charlie anders|url=http://io9.com/5625031/want-to-understand-inception-read-the-screenplay|title=want to understand inception? read the screenplay!|publisher=[[io9]]|date=august 30, 2010|accessdate=october 23, 2010}}</ref><!--  do not add any detail about the ending here. add it to the "ending" section below -->'

aS'{{plot|date=november 2015}}during the [[american civil war]], [[jonah hex]] ([[josh brolin]]) served as a [[confederate states of america|confederate]] cavalryman until his commanding officer, [[quentin turnbull]] ([[john malkovich]]), a general for the confederates who is obsessed with the fall of the union, ordered him to burn down a hospital. hex refused, and was forced to kill his best friend, turnbull\'s son jeb. after the war, a vengeful turnbull and his right-hand man, burke ([[michael fassbender]]), a psychopathic sadist, tie up hex and force him to watch as his house is burned down with his wife and son inside. turnbull then brands hex\'s face with his initials, "qt", and leaves him to die of thirst or exposure. days later, [[indigenous peoples of the americas|american indians]] find jonah and revive him with their mystical powers. while they did manage to bring jonah back from the dead, it is stated that they couldn\'t bring "all of him back". as a result, jonah acquired the ability to, as long as he maintains physical contact with the corpse, temporarily resurrect and communicate with the dead; the corpse physically and mentally brought back to physical condition prior to death (apparently, only jonah sees them restored like that. to everyone else, they continue to seem decayed and lifeless). it is also explained that the fresher the dead, the quicker that body begins to burn up as they are being touched. once contact is broken, the corpse instantaneously reverts to its former, lifeless condition. when turnbull apparently dies in a hotel fire, hex satisfies his hunger for vengeance by turning to [[bounty hunting]].in [[1876]], hex rides into the town of stunk crick with four dead outlaws and demands his bounty, only to realize that the mayor and sheriff have no intention of paying, intending instead to kill hex for his own bounty. hex instead kills them and several sheriff\'s deputies, collects his bounty from the dead mayor\'s pockets, and leaves. in another part of the country, turnbull, alive and well, orchestrates the hijacking of a train carrying components of a classified weapon, slaughtering its military guards and civilian passengers alike. when informed of the theft, [[ulysses s. grant|president grant]] ([[aidan quinn]]) surmises that turnbull is planning a [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack for july 4, during the celebration of the american centennial. grant instructs army lieutenant grass ([[will arnett]]) to find hex and hire him to stop turnbull. jonah goes to a [[brothel]] and spends the night with lilah (aka [[tallulah black]]) ([[megan fox]]), a [[prostitution|prostitute]] attracted to the disfigured man for more than just professional reasons. as jonah prepares to leave the next morning, grass\' men burst in and tell jonah that turnbull is still alive. they show him a captured thug from the train hijacking who told them turnbull is headed northwest, before dying during interrogation. but jonah briefly resurrects the man and learns that he has no knowledge of turnbull\'s whereabouts; the best he can do is tell who recruited him, ex-colonel slocum ([[tom wopat]]), who is running an illegal [[deathmatch]] pavilion in [[south carolina]], to the southeast.with the help of a corrupt washington aristocrat, adleman lusk ([[wes bentley]]), turnbull tracks down and steals the remaining components of the weapon he is seeking. when hex confronts slocum in south carolina, slocum refuses to talk, sarcastically telling hex to ask turnbull\'s dead son, jeb, where his father is. jonah says that is a good idea, then overpowers slocum\'s men and throws slocum himself into the ring, to be killed by his own fighters. after setting fire to the ring, he frees a dog being tormented by slocum\'s handlers, which starts to follow him around. in a cemetery in [[gettysburg, pennsylvania|gettysburg]], jonah digs up and resurrects jeb turnbull (an uncredited [[jeffrey dean morgan]]). jonah apologizes for killing jeb, and says that his father has to be stopped before he murders more people. jeb reveals that his father is at fort resurrection, and then returns to the afterlife.after entering the fort, hex sees plans for the "superweapon" that turnbull has stolen and assembled. in another part of the fort, turnbull explains to burke that the weapon was designed by [[eli whitney]] for the u.s. military, but they refrained from building it after realizing it was simply too powerful to ever consider using. jonah confronts turnbull, killing several of his men, but turnbull escapes and hex receives a near-fatal wounding from burke, but is able to escape. he collapses in a field, hovering near death for several days. turnbull, anticipating that hex will return, sends burke to bring him "something hex loves." burke kidnaps lilah from the brothel. turnbull test-fires the "superweapon" on a small town in [[georgia (u.s. state)|georgia]], which is leveled to the ground, killing hundreds of civilians. when president grant receives the news, his aide reports that they have no idea where in the country turnbull will strike, and that they do not have enough military manpower to guard every centennial celebration. hex is found by his native american allies, who perform a ceremony that heals him. back on his feet, he relays a message to lt. grass that turnbull plans to attack [[washington, d.c.]], then rides to independence harbor alone to stop him.when jonah attempts to infiltrate the harbor where turnbull\'s [[ironclad warship]] is anchored, burke spots him and attacks him. hex overpowers and kills him, then uses his powers to bring burke back from the dead, just so hex can incinerate his body completely. jonah prepares to shoot turnbull but turnbull holds lilah at gunpoint and forces jonah to surrender. turnbull chains jonah and lilah in the hold of his ship and tells jonah that he wants him to watch as the union is destroyed. the ship leaves harbor and steams toward washington, d.c. a [[monitor (warship)|monitor]] commanded by lt. grass intercepts turnbull, but is quickly destroyed with the weapon, which has been mounted on the bow.in the hold, lilah picks her handcuffs and frees herself and jonah. she holds off the guards with two pistols while jonah rushes up to the deck to stop turnbull. turnbull gains the upper hand and orders the weapon to fire. the weapon blankets washington with a volley of [[delay-action bomb]] shells, and turnbull gives the order for the trigger shell to be launched. but hex and turnbull\'s fight takes them down into the engine room, where hex throws his [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] into the weapon\'s belt feeder, trapping the trigger shell. he then brutally beats turnbull and traps his neck in a gear, before saving lilah. the pair jump into the water just as the trigger shell ignites in the engine room, killing turnbull and all his men. the next day, president grant rewards jonah with a large sum of money, a full pardon, and offers him a job as sheriff of the entire united states. jonah declines, but assures the president that if they need him, they\'ll be able to find him. lilah is waiting for him outside the [[white house]], and they leave the city together.in the last scene, jonah visits jeb\'s grave to apologize for having to kill his father, then rides out of the cemetery with his dog.'

their love life has become increasingly violent and she acquiesces to his desire to spank her. at first lou is satisfied, but his homicidal urges begin to resurface and he reflects on the inevitable circumstance of his killing amy. an [[alcoholic]] bum ([[brent briscoe]]) whom lou had previously burnt with a cigar has been trailing lou and has worked out that he was responsible for the murders of elmer and joyce and expects $5,000 to keep quiet. lou agrees to his demands and asks him to come back in two weeks, the date when he and amy plan to elope. when that day arrives lou punches and kicks amy to death in his kitchen, and when the bum enters and sees her body runs for help. lou chases the bum shouting that he has murdered amy. another deputy jeff plummer ([[matthew maher (actor)|matthew maher]]) opens fire on the bum and shoots him dead. the next morning plummer appears on lou\'s porch to tell him that maples has committed suicide, convinced of lou\'s guilt and heartbroken over his crimes. hendricks and plummer try to get a confession from lou, who cockily refuses. they have a letter that amy intended to give him before they eloped, in which amy begs him to come clean. lou is arrested and after a week in prison is sent to an [[insane asylum]]. while he is there he suffers hallucinations of a photographic slideshow featuring amy and helene on his bedroom wall. after a few weeks, a slick lawyer, billy boy walker ([[bill pullman]]) has him released and drives him home. walker has been hired by joe rothman to protect the union man from the suggestion that he was also involved in the conway murder. lou tells walker his whole story and concludes that he doesn\'t want anyone else to die, but hints that his imminent death will not add to the tally as he is "already dead". lou, now lost entirely in his own violent fantasies, douses his home in gasoline and alcohol, dresses himself smartly for his own demise and armed with a knife sits waiting in his study for a real or an imagined retribution to arrive. reality and fantasy blur as police vehicles and armed policemen are seen converging on the house, but looking out of the window lou sees a car pull up with hendricks, conway, plummer and the resurrected joyce, scarred but alive. joyce tells lou that she refused to cooperate with the authorities, lou tells her he loves her and then stabs her. plummer opens fire, hitting both joyce and lou and igniting the gasoline in the house. outside, the approaching policemen see the house explode in a huge fireball, which it appears lou has ignited to kill himself.'

while hunting, they discover an iceberg that when broken open shoots a beam of light into the sky. inside of the iceberg is a thirteen-year-old boy named [[aang]] and a giant flying bison named [[appa (character)|appa]]. unknown to them, aang is the long-lost avatar \xe2\x80\x94 the only person capable of "bending" all four elements of water, earth, air, and fire. one hundred years have passed since the fire nation has declared war on the other three nations of air, water, and earth in their attempt to conquer the world.[[zuko]] is the scarred seventeen-year-old exiled prince of the fire nation on a quest to find the avatar and bring him to his father, [[ozai|fire lord ozai]], so he can regain his honor. seeing the light that appeared from aang\'s release, zuko and some fire nation soldiers arrive at the southern water tribe to demand the villagers hand over the avatar. aang reveals himself and surrenders to zuko on the condition that he agrees to leave the village alone. on the ship, aang is tested by zuko\'s paternal uncle [[iroh]] to confirm he is the avatar. after being informed that he is to be their prisoner for passing the test, aang escapes using his glider and flies to his flying bison brought by katara and sokka. aang and his new friends visit the southern air temple where they meet a winged lemur, who aang later names [[momo (avatar: the last airbender)|momo]]. aang also learns that he was in the ice for a whole century and that the fire nation wiped out all of the air nomads, including his guardian, monk gyatso. in despair, he enters the avatar state and finds himself in the spirit world where he encounters a dragon spirit. katara\'s pleas bring aang back out of the avatar state.to seek shelter, aang\'s group arrives at a little earth kingdom village controlled by the fire nation, but are arrested because katara tries to help a young boy escape from fire nation soldiers. they incite a rebellion by reminding the disgruntled earthbenders that earth was given to them. aang tells katara and sokka that he only knows airbending and must master the other three elements. katara is given a waterbending scroll that she uses to greatly strengthen and hone her waterbending abilities and to help aang learn as they make their way to the northern water tribe (where aang will be able to learn from waterbending masters) and liberate more earth kingdom villages in the process, weakening the fire nation\'s food and water supplies.during a side track to the northern air temple on his own, aang is betrayed by a peasant and captured by a group of fire nation archers, led by [[admiral zhao|commander zhao]], a fire nation commander appointed by the fire lord. however, a masked marauder, the "blue spirit", helps aang escape from his imprisonment. zhao realizes that zuko is the masked vigilante. he arranges to kill the prince, but zuko survives the attempt on his life with iroh\'s help. he sneaks aboard zhao\'s lead ship as his fleet departs for the northern water tribe, which is a heavy fortress, to capture the avatar. upon arriving, aang\'s group is welcomed warmly by the citizens of the northern water tribe. sokka quickly befriends the northern water tribe princess, [[princess yue|yue]]. after a few agreements, a waterbending master, pakku, teaches aang waterbending. katara also becomes a much stronger and more powerful waterbender due to her training with master pakku.soon, the fire nation arrives and zhao begins his attack while zuko begins his search for the avatar on his own. after defeating katara in a battle, zuko captures aang as he enters the spirit world to find the dragon spirit to give him the wisdom to defeat the fire nation who tells him to let his emotions "flow like water". returning to his body, aang battles zuko before katara freezes him. before leaving to join the battle, aang lowers the ice so that zuko can breathe. as the battle escalates, iroh watches zhao capture the moon spirit, with which its ocean spirit counterpart had assumed the form of a fish. despite iroh\'s pleas, zhao kills the moon spirit to strip all of the waterbenders of their ability to waterbend. yue explains to everyone that the moon spirit gave her life, willing to give it back as she dies in the process. with the tables turned, zhao finds out zuko survived. they almost fight before iroh appears and tells zuko it\'s not worth it. zhao is drowned by waterbenders after zuko and iroh leave him to his fate. aang remembers his life before being trapped in the ice, including when he left his home, seeing his master\'s face. with his waterbending powers and his emotions "flowing like water", aang enters the avatar state and raises the ocean into a gigantic wall to drive the armada back. aang now fully embraces his destiny as the avatar as he, katara and sokka prepare to continue their journey to the earth kingdom to find an earthbending teacher for aang. the fire lord learns of the defeat; angry over the betrayal of his brother iroh and the failure of his eldest son zuko, he tasks his youngest daughter [[azula]] (and zuko\'s sister) to stop the avatar from mastering earth and fire before the arrival of sozin\'s comet.'

aS'gaylord "greg" focker (stiller) is preparing to celebrate his twins\' fifth birthday party. things seem to go awry when greg\'s father-in-law jack byrnes (de niro) visits. recently, jack has been diagnosed with a heart condition and become embittered by his daughter debbie\'s divorce from her husband, bob (whose marriage was the social event in [[meet the parents|the first film]] and how jack and greg met), for cheating on her with a nurse. jack\'s plan was originally to name bob as his successor as head of the byrnes family, but decides to pass the role to greg, naming him "the godfocker." despite greg reluctantly accepting the role, jack begins to suspect greg of infidelity when he sees him with a drug representative, andi garcia (alba), who openly flirts with him, and the presence of sustengo erection pills in greg\'s house, which prompts jack to think greg is no longer sexually attracted to his wife, pam (polo). furthermore, jack starts to doubt greg\'s ability to provide for his family when he appears reluctant to send his children to a private school.during a medical conference promoting sustengo, greg meets bob at a bar. bob tells greg of jack\'s original intention to name him as successor, "the bobfather," and expresses relief and happiness at leaving jack\'s family, which makes greg slightly uncomfortable. jack, for his part, begins speaking with pam about the possibility of divorcing greg and renewing her relationship with her ex-fianc\xc3\xa9, kevin rawley (wilson). eventually, following a row at a clinic, greg runs away from home to his and pam\'s unfinished new house, where he is paid a brief visit by andi, who tries to cheer him up with takeout and wine, but andi soon becomes so drunk that she makes an aggressive sexual pass at greg. while looking for greg, so he can apologize to him and bring him home, jack pulls up to the house and sees, through the window, what looks to him like greg and andi having sex, when, in reality, greg is trying to rebuff andi\'s advances. disgusted, jack merely leaves, but tells dina and pam that he was unable to find greg.at the twins\' birthday party, greg\'s parents, bernie (hoffman) and roz (streisand) rejoin the family, but jack, enraged at greg\'s apparent infidelity, engages greg in a physical fight, despite greg\'s claiming that andi was drunk and that he was rebuffing her. the fight culminates in jack\'s having a [[heart attack]] and collapsing. as he is taken away by paramedics, jack quietly admits that he now believes greg after feeling his carotid artery, which remained stable while greg was claiming his innocence.four months later, on christmas day, greg and pam\'s parents come to spend christmas with them in their new house. greg\'s parents (who are [[jewish]]) give jack a [[kippah]] as his present, informing him that they have traced his family roots while they were nursing him back to health, and discovered that he is part jewish, which didn\'t impress jack very much. bernie informs greg and pam that he and roz have sold their [[miami]] island home and are moving to [[chicago]], only two houses down from their house. jack and dina decide they will move, too, because they also want to be close to their grandchildren. the film ends with greg and pam trying to wean their parents off the idea. during the credits, jack is back in his home on long island. he has grown fond of the search engine [[google]] (having used it to do research on andi earlier in the film). with mr. jinx, the family\'s cat, jack watches a video of greg on [[youtube]] in which greg mocks him at the sustengo conference. jack then discovers a remixed version of the video using puns of several of the words in the video, and is slightly amused by it.'

stainer tells kirk that he is a "10" too. they pull kirk off his plane as the aircraft prepares to depart to branson as he tries to leave with his family and marnie, while patty brings molly to the airport. kirk rejects marnie during an unorthodox airport pursuit and meets molly in the airport where she tells him that he is out of shape and she asked him out because she thought he was safe and wouldn\'t hurt her. she then continues to tell him that she doesn\'t care what he is employed as and that she misses him and wants to be together with him. kirk and molly then make up and resume their relationship, even if their friends don\'t approve it.later, as a surprise, kirk is seen walking on the airport tarmac with molly where he  takes molly on a trip in a small plane, with him as the pilot. the couple are last seen happily together in a small plane taking off from pittsburgh airport.'

"edward daniels" and "rachel solando", as dr. cawley points out, are [[anagram]]s of "andrew laeddis" and "dolores chanal". two real names produce two fictitious ones. this is the meaning behind the mysterious "law of 4". laeddis himself, as it turns out, is the actual 67th patient at ashecliffe. thus the question, "who is 67?" is actually a reference to himself. furthermore, the little girl from andrew\'s recurring dreams is his own daughter, rachel. the events of the last few days have all been designed by dr. cawley as a radical form of intervention therapy to break andrew\'s [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]]-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of edward daniels. investigating the disappearance of a patient (solando) was the "storyline". the guards, the staff and even the patients at ashecliffe all played their various roles. andrew\'s primary psychologist, dr. lester sheehan, posed as aule, primarily to shepherd laeddis around, while a nurse posed as solando. the migraine headaches laeddis suffered resulted from being deprived of his prescribed medication. daniels/laeddis falls unconscious from the trauma of these revelations.andrew awakens in a hospital bed and is questioned by cawley and sheehan to determine whether or not he has lapsed back into his delusional state of mind. laeddis passes their test with ease. cawley notes, however, that they had previously achieved this state nine months prior to andrew\'s regression, only for him to relapse, and this is to be his last chance at rehabilitation. next morning, as laeddis relaxes on the hospital steps with doctor sheehan, he again mentions looking for a way to escape from the island. dr. sheehan interprets this as a sign of a relapse and signals other staff members to approach. andrew rises from the steps and calmly walks over to the awaiting orderlies and staff. his last comment to dr. sheehan, however, indicates that his \'relapse\' may be merely an act. the comment is a speculation in the form of a rhetorical question: "which would be worse \xe2\x80\x93 to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?"<ref name="cox-guardian" />'

(short for nucleic exchange research and development). their work previously yielded fred, a [[dog]]-sized [[vermiform]] creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, ginger. after successfully mating them, clive and elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. their employers joan chorot of n.e.r.d. and william barlow forbid them to do this. instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from fred and ginger. clive and elsa pursue their own agenda in secret. they develop a viable prepubescent female creature.although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, elsa persuades clive to let it live. the hybrid subsequently becomes aggressive and stings elsa several times. the hybrid sheds body parts in an effort to escape when they try to destroy her, but they subdue her. they discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. elsa names the creature "dren" after the creature spells out nerd, having seen the letters on elsa\'s shirt. elsa subsequently refuses to let clive refer to her as a "specimen".after moving dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. in an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink full of cold water. clive places a hand around dren\'s neck and pushes her under the water, seemingly drowning her. however, it is found that dren is [[amphibian|amphibious]], though it is unclear whether clive knew this, having analysed scans of dren, or whether he did intend to kill her.while studying dren, elsa and clive neglect their work with fred and ginger. at a highly publicized presentation of their work, fred and ginger savagely fight to the death. it is subsequently discovered that ginger [[sequential hermaphroditism|had spontaneously changed to a male]], but elsa and clive failed to notice because they were focused on dren.elsa forms a motherly bond with dren. after dren attacks clive\'s brother, gavin, they move her to an isolated farm. there, dren develops [[carnivorous]] tendencies and retractable wings. she grows into adolescence and becomes bored with being locked up in the barn, but elsa and clive fear that letting her outside might lead to her discovery. clive realizes that the human dna used to make dren was elsa\'s, not from an anonymous donor as elsa had told him. when dren assaults elsa again, elsa removes dren\'s stinger and uses it to synthesize the protein for which they had been searching.dren seduces clive; elsa discovers them having sex in the barn and becomes upset. clive accuses elsa of never wanting a "normal" child because of her fear of losing control; instead she chose to raise one as an experiment, where control could be assured. deciding the only solution is to terminate dren, they return to the farm and find dren already dying.william barlow discovers human dna in dren\'s protein samples and arrives to investigate. elsa tells barlow that dren is dead and buried behind the barn. however, a winged, male dren rises from the grave and attacks the group, killing barlow and gavin.  the male dren rapes elsa, before clive attacks him.  dren overwhelms clive, when elsa attacks with a large rock.  elsa then hesitates, allowing dren to kill clive before elsa finally kills her creation.elsa is later informed that dren\'s body contained numerous biochemical compounds for which the company has begun filing patents. joan offers elsa, now visibly pregnant with dren\'s baby, a large sum of money to go through with the pregnacy, which elsa accepts.'

$100,000. at travis\'s suggestion, he and dwayne devise a plot to kidnap a complete stranger and strap a remote-controlled bomb to his chest, to compel him to rob a bank for them for the hit money dwayne needs. after seeing an advertisement for the pizzeria that nick works at, they order a pizza and wait for a driver to come to their hideout. when nick arrives, dwayne and travis (who are wearing a [[gorilla]] and [[monkey]] mask) assault him and travis [[chloroform]]s nick.when nick wakes up, he finds a vest rigged with explosives strapped and buckled onto his torso, with both a timer and a cellular phone-activated trigger. disguised, dwayne and travis tell him his situation: if he does not rob a bank within 10 hours, the bomb will detonate. for effect, dwayne demonstrate another bomb blowing up a stuffed [[teddy bear]]. dwayne states that if nick dares going to the police, they will remotely detonate the bomb, as they will be monitoring him. in his panic, nick goes to a

dwayne for not giving chango the code to the bomb, and dares him to detonate the bomb with the money at his side. nick tells chet that this is a tactic for when the third call is made to them, the details to leave the money and the codes will be made. overly frustrated by the turn of events and when nick doesn\'t answer the phone again, dwayne activates the speed dial number on his phone for the bomb to explode, but travis altered the numbers while dwayne wasn\'t looking because he was getting nervous about dwayne\'s gradually violent attitude. when dwayne thinks that nick is calling him, it is instead chango who informs him about what had happened during the exchange. chango states that the deal is off and that he\'ll be coming after dwayne next. rethinking their plan, the two head to kate\'s apartment in their masks and kidnap her while she was in the restroom. chango breaks into the major\'s house to find information regarding dwayne\'s location and finds a hand-drawn map to the scrapyard. while there, the major attacks him with a pen gun as chango asks why he is protecting dwayne if he is the one that called the hit. the major is then shot in the stomach by chango after a struggle. upon applying some peroxide, chango uses the information he found in dwayne\'s room to head to the scrapyard. dwayne calls nick to let him know that he has kate and if he doesn\'t meet at the scrapyard to give him the money, he will kill her. nick arrives at the scrapyard and exchanges the money for kate. dwayne gives nick the code (which is dwayne\'s favorite sexual position: 69 69 69) to deactivate and unbuckle the bomb with just minutes to spare. dwayne has them at gunpoint but nick has chet fake having a sniper on them by pointing with his laser pointer. dwayne and travis believe him and drop their weapons and leave with the money. however, nick is brutally knocked out by chango who now has dwayne at gunpoint, demanding for the money. dwayne gives him the money but

failure, he goes to his father\'s mansion to see if chango successfully killed him. dwayne finds his dad on the floor suffering from his gunshot wound and tells about his plans for the tanning

steve argues that one missed present out of billions is an acceptable error whose correction can wait a few days. grandsanta on the other hand, apparently learning of the dire situation, proposes delivering the gift using eve, his old wooden sleigh, and the great-great-grandchildren of the original eight [[reindeer]], forcefully whisking away a reluctant arthur and a stowaway bryony. they get lost in three different continents, lose several of their reindeer, and land in danger several times, ultimately being mistaken for aliens and causing an international military incident. through all this, arthur eventually learns, to his compounding disappointment, that grandsanta's true motive is to fulfill his ego, that steve refuses to help them out of petty resentment and possibility of his brother being made hero overshadowing his work, and that his own father has gone to bed, apparently content even though a present was not delivered.finally, stranded in cuba after losing the sleigh and the remaining reindeer, arthur renews his sense of purpose\xe2\x80\x94that it all comes down to having presents delivered, regardless of how it is done and who did it\xe2\x80\x94and with grandsanta's and bryony's help manages to recover the sleigh. meanwhile, the elves grow increasingly alarmed at rumours of this neglected delivery and the clauses' unthinkable indifference, sending them into a panic. in response, malcolm, margaret, and steve take the high-tech sleigh-craft to deliver a superior present\xe2\x80\x94to the wrong child.in the meantime, arthur and his party lose the remaining reindeer and a us predator drone scrambled by chief de silva of unfita intercepts and opens fire on them thinking that they were aliens, causing arthur to bail out of the sleigh, via parachute. ultimately with margaret and bryony's help, all the male clauses arrive at gwen's house before she awakens, only to have all but arthur quarrel about who gets to actually place the gift. noticing that only arthur truly cares about the girl's feelings, the elder clauses collectively realise that he is the sole worthy successor. as a result, malcolm gives arthur the honour and steve, upon learning of his own errors, acknowledges that his brother is the worthy santa instead of him and forfeits his supposed birthright to his brother. in a fitting conclusion, gwen glimpses a snow-bearded arthur in a wind-buffeted sweater just before he vanishes up into the s-1.with the crisis resolved, malcolm goes into a happy retirement with margaret; he also becomes grand-santa's much-desired new companion and plays arthur's board game with him for many happy hours. meanwhile, steve finds true contentment as [[chief operating officer]] while bryony is promoted to vice-president of packing, pacific division. in a nod to traditionalism once neglected, the high-tech s-1 is re-christened evie in honour of grandsanta's old sleigh and refitted to be pulled by a team of five thousand reindeer\xe2\x80\x94led by the original eight, all of whom managed to return safely via innate navigational abilities. finally, arthur happily guides the entire enterprise in the proper spirit as the new santa."

aS'{{plot|date=november 2015}}nathan hayes ([[ken bevel]]) is at a gas station in albany, georgia, trying to clean his windshield when his truck is stolen. hayes runs after the truck, clinging to the side and fighting the thief through the open window. hayes is then thrown from the truck and it crashes into a tree. the perpetrator escapes, and hayes is shown in pain and struggling to get to his truck. bystanders tell him not to worry about the vehicle but he is not concerned about the vehicle at all and opens the back door to reveal his infant son, crying in his car seat, apparently unharmed.after bystanders call an ambulance, the police also arrive. adam mitchell ([[alex kendrick]]) and his partner and best friend shane fuller ([[kevin downes]]) meet hayes, discovering he will be a new deputy there, having recently moved from atlanta.  mitchell and fuller later have a discussion concerning the actions of hayes and ask each other if they would do the same thing as he did if they were in his shoes.as the deputies meet, the sheriff encourages them to spend time with their families, citing research that shows fatherless children are several times more likely to get into trouble in life, including crime. among his deputies is former rookie david thomson ([[ben davies (actor)|ben davies]]) who has survived his first year and will partner with hayes. mitchell adores his nine-year-old daughter, emily (lauren etchells), but is distant from his fifteen-year-old son, dylan (rusty martin), because mitchell doesn\'t share dylan\'s interest in [[5k run]]s. hayes never knew his biological father (who had 6 children with three different women) as his father left the family before he was born, instead treating his neighbor who acted as his mentor as his father (even giving him father\'s day cards annually), but would risk his life to save his three children; however, his teenage daughter jade (taylor hutcherson), resents him because he has a strict policy about dating, as he deems her too young for that. fuller is divorced, as were his parents, and has joint custody of his son.  he gets to see him every other weekend and a third of his paycheck goes toward alimony. thomson is young and single.as the four deputies meet over the weekend at a steak cookout, they discuss the sheriff\'s e-mail and [[father]]hood.  hayes grew up seeing the consequences of having an absent father and wondered where all the good fathers went.  we learn that fuller\'s father was an usher at church but his heart was not in it as he would step outside for a smoke once the service started.  he even warned him not to drink while holding a can of beer.  fuller, while he still loves him, has a hard time respecting him.  thomson\'s father split with his mother after an affair and thomson resigns to accepting divorce as a part of marriage.  hayes disagrees as he views divorce as something that couples purposely include as part of their marriage when it doesn\'t have to be.  mitchell agrees with hayes and sees that many couples do not put forth the effort to fight for their marriages.  hayes and mitchell credit their faith in god for keeping their marriage and family intact (hayes more than mitchell).  thomson on the other hand gets a little uncomfortable with the mention of god and tries to defuse the tension by saying that not everyone believes in god and that religion is only one way to keep marriages intact but it doesn\'t work for everyone.javier martinez (robert amaya), an immigrant struggling to provide for his family, is walking down an alley asking god what he wants him to do after being laid off when a construction company went over budget and mitchell calls him over to help with his shed, thinking he is a different javier that mitchell\'s friend fuller said would be there. after paying him for the job, mitchell recommends him to a new full-time job, where he is hired. meanwhile, derrick freeman (david howze), a teenager who hayes had earlier disapproved of dating jade, due to his rude and disrespectful behavior towards hayes despite hayes invite for a sunday lunch to get to know him better, joins a gang involved in drug dealing.  the gang leader also happens to be the same individual who tried to steal hayes\' truck at the beginning of the movie.one tragic day, emily is killed by a drunk driver, devastating mitchell and his family and bringing him closer to his son. following his daughter\'s death, mitchell reads a lot about fatherhood in the bible. he decides he must be a better father and crafts a detailed "resolution" to honor god in every aspect of his family. mitchell, hayes, fuller, thomson, and martinez join him in his resolution at a formal ceremony conducted by hayes\'s neighborhood mentor, the man he thinks of as a father. mitchell rebuilds a relationship with his son by running with him to prepare for the 5k race and receives some relief of his guilt at his daughter\'s death.  he even goes as far as doing his side of the dance with his daughter whom he refused to dance with while she was alive. hayes mends his relationship with his daughter and presents her with a purity ring that he asks her to wear until she is married. he also visits the grave of his biological father who he had never met and forgives him. fuller improves his relationship with his son. thomson reveals to hayes that he fathered a child in college and deserted the mother after she refused to have an abortion.  he lives only 30 minutes away from her but doesn\'t have the courage to go see them. he feels guilty and hayes uses the opportunity to witness to him about christ and shares his testimony.  thomson later writes the mother a letter seeking a relationship with his daughter and encloses some support money. martinez\'s factory employer offers him a promotion on the condition that he falsify inventory documents. martinez refuses, and his boss reveals that the condition was a test of martinez\'s integrity, with martinez being the only one to pass after interviewing 6 previous candidates. the boss promotes martinez and gives him a raise.mitchell discovers that someone has been stealing drugs from police evidence. mitchell decides he must honor his resolution and report the corruption. he sets up a sting with help from hayes leading to fuller\'s arrest and imprisonment. fuller has been stealing drugs to sell on the side and blames his actions on a low salary ($36,000 a year.)  mitchell later breaks the news to fuller\'s son and visits fuller in jail where fuller takes responsibility for his actions and asks mitchell to forgive him and be a father figure to his son, which mitchell agrees to do.during a minor traffic stop for a blown out taillight, hayes and thomson unknowingly confront the armed leader of a gang they have been repeatedly encountering. one of the gang members is derrick, who stops the gang leader named tj from shooting hayes with a shotgun. the incident turns into a roadside gun battle, and  tj attempts to take a young girl hostage to use as collateral. mitchell and other officers arrive as backup. the girl\'s father assists hayes in subduing a suspect, and mitchell assists in arresting a second suspect. when deputy hayes asks, derrick attributes his reason for being involved with the gang to not having anyone who cares about him.at a father\'s day church service, the men present the resolution and mitchell leads a charge to the fathers in the congregation to be a godly influence on their families. mitchell runs in a 5k race with his son and fuller\'s son. hayes reads the bible in prison with derrick. thomson meets his daughter for the first time. the film ends with a quote from [[book of joshua|joshua 24:15]]: "choose today whom you will serve, but as for me and my house, we will serve the lord."'

aS'in 1987, [[latif yahia]] ([[dominic cooper]]), an iraqi soldier fighting in the [[iran\xe2\x80\x93iraq war]], is called to become a "\'\'fedai\'\'" ("[[body double]]" or [[political decoy]]) for [[uday hussein]] (also played by cooper), the playboy son of iraqi president [[saddam hussein]] ([[philip quast]]). latif comes from an upper-class family and had attended school with uday, where the other students would remark on their likeness. latif initially refuses the position, but is imprisoned and tortured, ultimately relenting when his family is threatened. latif undergoes minor cosmetic surgery to perfect his resemblance to uday and practices emulating the young hussein\'s mannerisms and wildly volatile persona. he is given access to all of the luxurious benefits of the husseins\' fortune, including massive palaces, expensive wardrobes and uday\'s [[ferrari mondial#3.2 mondial|ferrari]] and various other exotic cars. latif tries to resist uday\'s exorbitant merrymaking and erratic behavior, at one point fleeing a nightclub in another of uday\'s ferraris to attempt to see his family, who believe he has died in the war. however, he is apprehended by uday\'s bodyguards and given a whipping by uday. after an appearance at a conference with several [[kuwait]]i leaders, an attempt is made on uday\'s (latif\'s) life, apparently by a member of a rebel opposition group, possibly a [[kurdish people|kurd]]. the real uday, though, is more concerned with the kuwaitis, who he believes have been [[directional drilling|slant drilling]] into iraq\'s [[rumaila oil field]]. the [[gulf war|first gulf war]] is launched with uday proclaiming "the age of the [[sheikh]]s is over!"uday\'s increasingly violent, sadistic tendencies are displayed when he kidnaps a 14-year-old school girl and forces her to escort him to a party. at the party, based on an actual 1988 celebration honoring egyptian president [[hosni mubarak]]\'s wife [[suzanne mubarak|suzanne]], uday becomes enraged with his father\'s personal bodyguard [[kamel hana gegeo]] ([[mehmet ferda]]). uday believes gegeo facilitated an affair between saddam and [[samira shahbandar]], which devastated his mother, [[sajida talfah]], and he also expresses jealousy at the trust his father places in kamel hana. when gegeo passes sarcastic comments about uday\'s sexual advances towards his young victim, uday butchers him with an [[electric knife|electric carving knife]] in front of all of the guests. the next morning, uday\'s bodyguards are seen dumping the partially naked, beaten body of the young girl.latif, acting as uday, is later sent to [[basra]] to rally support among [[republican guard (iraq)|republican guard]] soldiers as [[coalition of the gulf war|coalition]] forces have taken control of the war. at basra, another attempt is made on latif\'s life. to uday\'s great concern, latif nearly loses a little finger in the assault, which presumably would mean uday would have to have his amputated to maintain their resemblance, but doctors are able to save latif\'s finger. later, latif is confronted by the father of the young girl uday killed. uday eavesdrops on the conversation and is outraged by the man\'s pleas for "justice" and "compassion." uday orders latif to kill the man, but latif refuses and instead slits his own wrists, to uday\'s amusement. after latif recovers, he confronts uday at his birthday party. the confrontation escalates to a shootout and latif escapes in uday\'s [[mercedes-benz w126|mercedes]] with uday\'s lover, sarrab ([[ludivine sagnier]]). the two escape to [[valletta]], but sarrab, fearing for her daughter in iraq, calls uday begging for the chance to return without being harmed. a would-be assassin sent by uday just misses shooting latif almost as soon as they arrive on the island. uday calls latif and offers him one final chance to return to iraq, threatening to kill his father if he refuses. latif\'s father encourages him not to return and he is killed.however, latif does return to iraq, not to continue to serve as uday\'s double, but rather to kill him, with the help of a man whose bride killed herself after being raped and beaten by uday on her wedding day. in an adapted version of the attempt on uday\'s life made by the [[islamic movement of the 15th of shaaban|15th shaaban]] in 1996, latif and his partner ambush uday while he is attempting to lure young girls into his [[porsche 911|porsche]]. they wound him severely, including mangling his genitals with a direct shot. one of uday\'s bodyguards catches up to latif as he flees the scene. the guard, however, is one who latif could have killed as he fled from uday\'s birthday party before leaving the country but spared, and the guard extends him the same courtesy.the movie ends by stating that latif has been a very difficult man to find after these events.

humans. the two eventually flee (under sven\'s mistaken assumption that the humans were going to eat them) and end up on [[antarctica]], where sven performs his first miracle by revealing moss to the local penguins. sven uses his power of "sven think" to help ramon find a mate. ramon instantly falls in love with carmen, another ad\xc3\xa9lie penguin who is uninterested. mumble follows the chicks\' footprints to ad\xc3\xa9lie-land and orders them to return to emperor-land, but they refuse. sven sends erik back to emperor-land with mumble. meanwhile, a couple of [[krill]] are in the midst of a

penguins encounter [[elephant seal]] bryan the beach master and his two young sons, who refuse to let the penguins pass. suddenly the ice gives away and bryan is trapped in a deep crevice below the ice. mumble sets out to free bryan by luring a [[leopard seal]] to chase him down. seeking acceptance from erik, mumble is devastated to learn erik attributed the feat of courage to sven think. bryan returns to the [[southern elephant seal]] beach.when the penguins return to emperor-land they discover that a large iceberg has trapped the emperor penguin population below large walls of ice. bo ventures out to ad\xc3\xa9lie-land to recruit the help of ramon, the amigos and the ad\xc3\xa9lie penguins to bring fish to the doomed emperor penguins. meanwhile, mumble, erik and atticus deliver meager supplies of fish to the trapped penguins. erik attempts to deliver a fish to gloria by flying and nearly tossing himself over the edge of the iceberg. mumble scolds erik for his beliefs, saying that no penguin can fly and that none of the emperor penguins will be able to escape. once erik realizes emperor-land is destined to die, he begins to break down. gloria sends mumble off to hunt for fish, calming erik and the rest of the hysterical emperor-land. in the process, bill becomes inspired to create another swarm of krill but will refuses, preferring to adhere to his new predator

seems lost, bo returns with the entire ad\xc3\xa9lie-land, led by sven, to aid the trapped emperor penguins. sven orchestrates a cooperative effort to feed the trapped emperor penguins through hunting and bringing back a flow of fish from the sea. meanwhile, will becomes increasingly agitated with bill\'s behavior and leaves him into the ad\xc3\xa9lie feeding swarm, to join "fellow predators". in the process he is attached to a fish carried by sven and down into the trapped emperor-land. the humans that saved sven and lovelace come to antarctica again to help the penguins find a way out. however, a blizzard approaches and causes the humans to flee and not return. sven reports that the ocean has frozen over significantly and there is no chance of the humans returning or the ad\xc3\xa9lie penguins transporting food over such a distance. erik urges sven to teach the penguins how to fly, but sven reveals that he is not a penguin but a [[atlantic puffin|puffin]]. he admits that after the loss of svenland, he was lonely and grew to love the penguins who accepted him as a family. mumble, after watching snow fall into a crevice between chunks of iceberg, begins to tap-dance on the ice and lead the ad\xc3\xa9lie penguins in a dance to force snow between the ice and weaken it. the plan works until several chunks break loose, sending bo, atticus, and a portion of the ad\xc3\xa9lies as well as several [[chinstrap penguin|chinstrap]], [[little blue penguin|little blue]] and [[magellanic penguin|magellanic]] penguins into the doomed crevice. erik and lovelace tumble towards the edge, and mumble grabs the thread from lovelace\'s vest. the thread snaps and lovelace falls on sven. mumble and the amigos pull on the thread that erik is holding onto and pull him up but mumble injures his foot, unable to dance and lead the ad\xc3\xa9lies. ramon realizes carmen is trapped below and, risking his own life, jumps off the iceberg to be with her and professes their love to each other. sven becomes aware of the dancing and proves himself to be a worthy dancer despite public outcry against him. he leads the remaining ad\xc3\xa9lies in dance while erik and mumble venture off to the elephant seal beach.meanwhile, will, weary from the dangers he experienced as a predator on the surface, ventures back into the sea to find bill, but not before experiencing the penguin\'s dancing. he is suddenly forced down a crack in the ice and into the sea beneath emperor-land. reuniting with bill and his swarm, the krill enter the inaccessible ice below emperor-land. mumble and erik arrive at elephant seal beach where bryan is in the middle of a fight of dominance between another large male. mumble pleads to the elephant seals to help free the emperor penguins.

being bothered by mark during a film in one of his classes, john\'s hands begin to glow and burn brightly, similar to the glow on his leg in the ocean, and he sweats profusely. he runs from the classroom and into a janitorial closet to soak his hands in water to calm the burning. henri, alerted by a loric box that he has kept, comes to john and explains that the glowing is the awakening of john\'s "legacies". as these powers grow, john will become more powerful but, in order to maintain a low profile, henri forbids john from using these powers. john disobeys, sneaks out of his house, and goes to a nearby forest where he finds that he is able to throw large rocks at supersonic speeds, run faster than he ever could before, and survive long falls with ease.later that night, john goes into town to walk around for a bit and runs into sarah. he confronts her about the pictures that he found on her website and she admits to being an avid photographer. as they walk together, they see sam across the street being yelled at by his step-father. john walks sarah the rest of the way to her house, where she invites him in for dinner with her family. her parents seem to like john and suggest that he and sarah go to the carnival together. after dinner, john and sarah head up to her room. she shows john some of her favorite photos that she has taken. john finds a scrapbook of personal photos that sarah\'s taken of herself along with things she\'s written but she takes it back before he can read much of it. bernie kosar shows up outside of sarah\'s house, barking loudly, and john gets up to leave. sarah gives him a camera of her own for him to keep and they nearly kiss but john leaves quickly because of bernie kosar\'s constant barking.the following day at school, sam asks about the lights in class but john passes it off as a prank with some flashlights. as sam is warning john to stay away from sarah, their lockers explode with pink paint placed by mark. john\'s hands begin to glow again but he\'s able to hide it by clenching his fists, as he narrowly avoids getting into a fight with mark. while john and sam are cleaning up in the bathroom, sam tells john about how he and his father used to go looking for aliens, though his father suddenly disappeared one day.during the spring fair, sarah explains to john that she and mark used to date. she talked about how she had "refused to be his personal cheerleader" and instead wanted to be a photographer. mark had told her that she was being snobby and convinced the entire school that she was crazy. john and sarah go on a haunted wagon ride through the woods. when they get off, mark\'s friends tackle john and begin to beat him while one brings sarah to mark. john uses his legacies to fend them off and rescue sarah. sam witnesses john\'s use of his legacies and john reveals his true origins to sam. the next day, mark\'s father, the local sheriff, interrogates henri on john\'s whereabouts when his son and his friends were attacked, where john says he wasn\'t paying any attention to mark, since he was with a girl.henri tells john that too many people are suspicious of them, so they have to leave. john refuses because he doesn\'t want to leave sarah. meanwhile, the mogadorians continue searching for john, while being trailed by a mysterious woman who is also trying to locate number four.the mogadorians eventually locate john and manipulate two conspiracy theorists into capturing henri. when john and sam go to rescue him, they are attacked, but manage to fend the mogadorians off. just before escaping, john and sam grab henri\'s knife and a loric artifact; a blue rock that acts as the first half of a tracking device that locates other loric children. knowing who sam is, henri reveals that his father was an ally that was helping them. as john, henri, and sam begin to drive away in sam\'s truck, henri is stabbed through the chest while trying to protect john from a mogadorian. john throws the mogadorian from the truck with his telekinesis and they drive away. henri later dies in john\'s arms after telling him to find the remaining children, as their combined powers would be enough to stop the mogadorians. sam reveals to john that he has another rock, very similar to the one found with the conspiracy theorists.while sam searches for it in his house, john tries to say goodbye to sarah at a party. mark sees john and calls his father, who corners john and sarah on the roof of the house that the party is being thrown at. as sarah stands up, she slips from the roof. john saves sarah from a fall with his telekinesis, revealing his powers in the process, and they escape to their high school.meanwhile, the commander arrives in paradise in a convoy of trucks. he confronts mark and his father. after injuring the sheriff, the commander forces mark to lead him to where john is hiding. mark takes him to the school, which he knows is sarah\'s hideout.there, john, sarah and sam are attacked by the mogadorians, who brought two giant monsters to hunt the trio. they are saved by number six and bernie kosar. number six reveals that bernie kosar is a [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]] that can shapeshift and was sent by john\'s biological parents to protect him. john and number six fight the mogadorians using their powers; number six uses her invisibility powers and john blocks energy attacks with telekinesis. meanwhile, bernie kosar, now in his true chimera form, fights one of the mogadorians\' monsters in the school\'s showers. he is able to defeat the monster. eventually, having ended up on the school\'s football stadium, john and number six defeat all of the mogadorians, including the commander, who dies in a large explosion triggered by john igniting the commander\'s bandoleer of ammunition. john survives this explosion when number six stands between him and the blast, revealing her ability to resist fire.the following day, number six unites john\'s and sam\'s blue rocks and discovers the location of the other four surviving garde. john allows sam to come with them with the hope of one day finding sam\'s father. they set off to find the others so they can all protect earth from the mogadorians. they leave behind sarah and a repentant mark, who lies to his father about john\'s whereabouts and returns the box left to john by his dad that was in police evidence. before leaving, john promises to return to paradise one day and kisses sarah one last time. just before getting in to sam\'s truck, bernie kosar, with a visibly injured paw, limps up to john.john, sam, and bernie kosar leave together in sam\'s truck, being led by number six on her motorcycle to where ever the next of the loric garde may be.'

aS'stephen meyers is the junior campaign manager for mike morris, [[governor of pennsylvania]] and a [[democratic party (united states)|democratic]] [[president of the united states|presidential]] candidate, competing against [[arkansas]] [[united states senate|senator]] ted pullman in the democratic primary. both campaigns are attempting to secure the endorsement of [[north carolina]] democratic senator franklin thompson, who controls 356 convention delegates, enough to clinch the nomination for either candidate. after a debate at [[miami university]], meyers is asked by pullman\'s campaign manager, tom duffy, to meet in secret. meyers calls his boss, senior campaign manager paul zara, who doesn\'t answer. meyers decides to meet duffy, who offers meyers a position in pullman\'s campaign, an offer meyers refuses. zara calls meyers back and asks what was important, but meyers says it was nothing to worry about. meanwhile, meyers starts a sexual relationship with molly stearns, an attractive [[intern]] for morris\'s campaign and daughter of jack stearns, the chairman of the [[democratic national committee]]. meyers admits to an angry zara that he met with duffy, and that duffy said his candidate will offer thompson the position of [[secretary of state]], guaranteeing pullman\'s victory. zara and meyers discuss the matter with morris, saying they must make the same offer to thompson to secure his endorsement and his delegates\' votes. morris refuses on principle, as he thoroughly disagrees with thompson and his policies, and wants a "clean" campaign without such deals. late one night when molly is sleeping, meyers discovers that morris is trying to call her after he picks up her phone by mistake. meyers finds out that molly and morris had a brief sexual liaison at a campaign stop in iowa several weeks previously, and molly is now pregnant by the governor, which will cause a scandal. meyers helps her with money but warns her not to tell anybody. meyers also fires molly from the campaign to make the problem go away. ida horowicz, a reporter for the \'\'[[new york times]]\'\', reveals to meyers that an anonymous source leaked his encounter with duffy to her. she also knows the morris campaign has talked to thompson. she says she will publish the duffy meet unless meyers gives her all of the details about the thompson meeting.meyers comes to zara for help, believing the story would damage him, zara, and the campaign. zara reveals that he leaked the meeting to ida with morris\'s approval in order to force meyers into resigning from the campaign, stating that he did this because meyers was disloyal for meeting with duffy. zara makes it clear that he holds no personal animosity against meyers and values him, but cannot trust him any more. an angry and desperate meyers then offers his services to duffy, who admits he only met with meyers in order to influence his opponent\'s operation under the likelihood that either meyers would leave morris and come to work for him or meyers would tell zara, and zara would fire him. either way, duffy would win.duffy apologizes for using him, saying that he also wanted to help meyers, and advises him to quit politics and the campaign before he becomes a cynic like him. meyers offers to sell out morris completely but duffy declines, thinking that meyers cannot hurt him and he has thompson wrapped up. meanwhile, molly learns that meyers has been fired and, fearing he will reveal her pregnancy, takes a fatal drug overdose. since both sides used him, meyers goes on the offensive against both as a revenge.unbeknownst to the morris campaign, he meets with thompson to arrange for thompson\'s delegates in exchange for a spot on the morris ticket. it is clear that thompson prefers morris over pullman so all meyers has done is get thompson to commit if he is offered the post with morris. meyers meets morris in a dark bar, telling him he will expose the affair with molly if morris does not accept his demands: fire zara, place meyers in charge of the campaign, and offer thompson the role of [[vice president of the united states|vice president]]. morris coldly says that there is no proof of the affair, but meyers claims to have a suicide note found in molly\'s room. morris relents, clearly giving up what is left of his personal integrity, and meets meyers\'s demands. zara takes his firing philosophically and is still positive with the press about morris. zara talks to meyers at molly\'s funeral and is amicable, letting meyers know that he knows meyers must have had something big on morris to get him to fire zara and hire him.  zara has options and states that he is taking a million dollar a year job at a consulting firm, for him basically a retirement from politics. later, thompson\'s endorsement makes morris the \'\'de facto\'\' nominee despite losing the democratic party\'s ohio [[primary election]]. duffy, who put meyers\'s back against the wall and who rejected meyers\'s offer of dirt against morris, is seen trying to put up a good face in what is now obviously going to be a defeat for his candidate.now senior campaign manager, meyers is on the way to a remote tv interview with [[john king (journalist)|john king]], when ida ambushes him and says her next story will be about how meyers delivered thompson and his delegates and got his promotion. meyers reacts by having security bar her from coming any further. meyers takes his seat for the interview, just as morris finishes a speech about how \'integrity and dignity\' matter, and is asked for insight as to how the events surrounding the primary unfolded.'

aS'before the dawn of man or beast, immortals waged war against each other in heaven. the victors declared themselves [[twelve olympians|gods]] while the vanquished were renamed the [[titan (mythology)|titans]] and imprisoned beneath mount [[tartarus]]. the epirus bow, a weapon of immense power, was lost on earth during the war. in 1228 b.c., the mortal king hyperion<ref>this "hyperion" in the movie is \'\'fictional\'\' and not [[hyperion (mythology)|hyperion the titan god]]</ref> ([[mickey rourke]]) of [[heraklion]] searches for the bow, intending to use it to release the titans to get revenge on the gods for failing to save his family. hyperion captures the virgin oracle [[phaedra (mythology)|phaedra]] ([[freida pinto]]), believing that she can use her visions to find the epirus bow\'s resting place.in a small village nearby, the inhabitants prepare to flee to mount tartarus to avoid hyperion\'s army. one inhabitant named theseus ([[henry cavill]]) is a skilled warrior trained by his mentor, a mysterious old man ([[john hurt]]). [[theseus]] and his mother aethra (anne day-jones), considered undesirables because theseus was born from aethra being raped, are forced to stay behind by athenian soldiers including lysander ([[joseph morgan (actor)|joseph morgan]]). theseus ably battles multiple opponents until the athenian officer helios ([[peter stebbings]]) intervenes and discharges lysander from the army for his actions. lysander travels to hyperion, offering his service and the village\'s location. hyperion accepts, but hammers lysander\'s testicles for being a traitor. hyperion\'s forces attack theseus\'s village, murdering the villagers and aethra, and taking theseus captive.the old man is revealed to be [[zeus]] ([[luke evans (actor)|luke evans]]) where he meets with his fellow gods [[athena]] ([[isabel lucas]]), [[poseidon]] ([[kellan lutz]]), [[ares]] ([[daniel sharman]]), [[apollo]] ([[corey sevier]]), and [[heracles]] ([[steve byers]]). zeus warns them not to interfere in mortal affairs as gods where zeus believes that until the titans are released, they must have faith in mankind to defeat hyperion. theseus is enslaved alongside the thief stavros ([[stephen dorff]]). phaedra, who is held captive nearby, sees a vision of theseus. phaedra organizes a riot, using the chaos to escape with theseus, stavros, and the other slaves. theseus decides to pursue hyperion and attempts to capture a boat, but he and his allies are overwhelmed by hyperion\'s forces. poseidon purposefully falls from olympus into the ocean causing a tsunami that wipes out hyperion\'s men. phaedra sees another vision of theseus standing near a shrouded body. she determines that theseus must return home to bury aethra.while laying aethra to rest, theseus discovers the epirus bow embedded in nearby rock. he frees the epirus bow, but is attacked by hyperion\'s henchman the [[minotaur]] ([[robert maillet]]). theseus kills the minotaur in a [[labyrinth]] and uses the bow to save his allies from being executed before collapsing from poisoned scratches inflicted by the minotaur. phaedra tends to theseus and later falls in love with him and they make love to each other, stripping her of the visions she deemed a curse. the group returns to phaedra\'s temple while hyperion and his forces are away at mount tartarus. at the temple, stavros and theseus are lured into an ambush and theseus loses the epirus bow. outnumbered by hyperion\'s men, ares directly intervenes to save theseus and athena provides the men with horses to reach mount tartarus. zeus arrives and angrily kills ares for disobeying his command. zeus tells theseus and his allies to let ares\' death be a warning to both the gods and them that they will receive no more help from the gods and he must justify the faith zeus has in him alone. before leaving with athena, zeus tells theseus to prove him right. the lost epirus bow is brought to hyperion.theseus, stavros, and phaedra travel to mount tartarus. theseus tries in vain to warn [[greeks|hellenics]]\' king cassander ([[stephen mchattie]]) of hyperion\'s plans, but cassander dismisses his talk of gods as myth, intending to negotiate peace with hyperion. the following day, hyperion uses the bow to destroy mount tartarus\' seemingly indestructible gate. theseus leads the hellenic army to war against the hyperion forces, killing lysander. hyperion ignores the battle, storms through to mount tartarus, and kills helios and cassander, using the epirus bow to breach the mountain and free the titans before stavros and theseus can stop him. the force of the release knocks the mortals down. stavros takes the epirus bow and kills a titan, but is killed by the other titans. zeus, poseidon, athena, heracles, and apollo arrive and battle the titans while theseus fights hyperion. zeus destroys the epirus bow, and the gods prove more than a match for the titans, but they are overwhelmed by their sheer numbers, with all but zeus and poseidon being killed. theseus kills hyperion and zeus collapses mount tartarus on the titans. as the mountain is collapsing, zeus picks up athena\'s body and ascends to olympus along with a badly wounded poseidon. the collapsing mountain wipes out hyperion\'s men. the mortally wounded theseus is also transported to olympus for his sacrifice and given a place among the gods.several years later, theseus\' story has become legend and phaedra has given birth to theseus\' son [[acamas (son of theseus)|acamas]] (gage munroe). acamas is met by the old man who informs the child that in the future, he too will one day fight against evil. acamas sees a vision of the sky filled with thousands of gods and titans fighting (including zeus and a now fully healed poseidon) with theseus leading the charge.'

aS'the film opens with j. edgar hoover in his office during his later years. he asks that a writer, known as agent smith, be let in, so that he may tell the story of the origin of the fbi for the sake of the public. hoover explains that the story begins in 1919, when [[a. mitchell palmer]] was attorney general and hoover\'s boss at the [[united states department of justice|justice department]]. palmer suffers an [[1919 united states anarchist bombings#june bombings|assassination attempt]], but is unharmed when the bomb explodes earlier than intended. hoover recalls that the police handling of the crime scene was primitive, and that it was that night that he recognized the importance of criminal science. later, hoover visits his mother, anna marie, and tells her that palmer has put him in charge of a new anti-radical division, and that he has already begun compiling a list of suspected radicals. he leaves to meet [[helen gandy]], who has just started as a secretary at the justice department. hoover takes gandy to the [[library of congress]], and shows her the card catalog system he devised. he muses about how easy it would be to solve crimes if every citizen were as easily identifiable as the books in the library. when hoover attempts to kiss her, she recoils. hoover gets down on his knees and asks her to marry him, citing her organization and education, but his request is once again denied. however, gandy agrees to become his personal secretary.despite his close monitoring of suspected foreign radicals, hoover finds that the [[united states department of labor|department of labor]] refuses to deport anyone without clear evidence of a crime; however, [[anthony caminetti]], the commissioner general of immigration dislikes the prominent [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[emma goldman]]. hoover arranges to discredit her marriage and make her eligible for deportation, setting a precedent of deportation for radical conspiracy. after several justice department [[palmer raids|raids]] of suspected radical groups, many leading to deportation, palmer loses his job as attorney general. under a subsequent attorney general, [[harlan f. stone]], hoover is made director of the justice department\'s [[federal bureau of investigation|bureau of investigation]]. he is introduced to [[clyde tolson]], a recently graduated lawyer, and takes his business card. later, while reviewing job applications with helen gandy, hoover asks if tolson had applied. gandy says he had, and hoover interviews and hires tolson.the bureau pursues a string of gangster and bank robbery crimes across the midwest, including the high profile [[john dillinger]], with general success. when the [[lindbergh kidnapping]] captures national attention, [[herbert hoover|president hoover]] asks the bureau to investigate. hoover employs several novel techniques, including the monitoring of registration numbers on ransom bills, and expert analysis of the kidnapper\'s handwriting. the birth of the [[federal bureau of investigation laboratory|fbi crime lab]] is seen as a product of hoover\'s determination to analyze the homemade wooden ladder left at the crime scene. when the monitored bills begin showing up in [[new york city]], the investigators find a filling station attendant who wrote down the license plate number of the man who gave him the bill. this leads to the arrest, and eventual conviction, of [[richard hauptmann|bruno richard hauptmann]] for the kidnapping and murder of the lindbergh child.after hoover, tolson, and hoover\'s mother attend a showing of the [[james cagney]] film \'\'[[g men]]\'\', hoover and tolson decide to go out to a club, where hoover is seated with anita colby, ginger rogers, and rogers\'s mother lela. when colby asks hoover if he ever wishes he had someone to keep him warm at night, he responds that he has dedicated his life to the bureau. ginger\'s mother asks hoover to dance and he becomes agitated, saying that he and tolson must leave, as they have a lot of work to do in the morning. when he gets home he shares his dislike of dancing with girls with his mother, and she tells him she would rather have a dead son than a "daffodil" for a son. she then insists on teaching him to dance, and they dance in her bedroom. soon after, hoover and tolson go on a vacation to the [[horse race]]s. that evening, hoover tells tolson that he cares deeply for him, and tolson returns the feeling by stating that he loves hoover. however, hoover claims to be considering marriage to a young woman twenty years his junior, [[dorothy lamour]], he has been seeing in new york city, provoking outrage from tolson. tolson accuses hoover making a fool out of him and then begins throwing insults at hoover, and consequently they begin throwing punches at each other and cause grave damage to the hotel room in the process; they eventually end up fighting on the floor. the fight ends when tolson gets an upper hand over hoover, and suddenly kisses him. hoover demands that it must never happen again; tolson says that it won\'t, and attempts to leave. hoover apologizes and begs him to stay, but tolson only says that if hoover ever mentioned another woman again, their friendship would be over. he then leaves, with hoover professing love for him moments after.years later, hoover feels his strength begin to decline. he requires daily visits by a doctor, and tolson suffers a stroke which leaves him in a severely weakened state. convincing himself that he overheard [[martin luther king, jr.]] engage in extramarital sex, hoover attempts to "racistly" blackmail king jr. into declining his [[nobel peace prize]] by writing a letter threatening to expose his sexual life.  the attempt proves ineffective, and king accepts the prize. hoover eventually begins to consider his mortality and tells helen gandy to destroy his secret files if he were to die, to prevent [[richard nixon]] from possessing them. when tolson appeals to hoover to retire when hoover comes to visit him, hoover refuses, claiming that nixon is going to destroy the bureau he has created. tolson then accuses hoover of exaggerating his involvement in many of the bureau\'s actions and giving inaccurate details about some of the events he encountered during his time with the bureau as well, revealing that \'\'he\'\' didn\'t kill dillinger, arrest hauptmann, that agent sisk did; hoover wasn\'t even at the scene, lindbergh didn\'t shake his or tolson\'s hand and insulted him, thus making hoover regret hiring him. however, moments later, hoover tells tolson that he needed him, more than he ever needed anyone else, and holds his hand, kisses his forehead and leaves.returning home one evening after work, hoover, obviously weakened, goes upstairs. shortly after, tolson is called by hoover\'s housekeeper and he goes upstairs to find hoover dead next to his bed. grief-stricken, he gently kisses hoover\'s forehead and covers his body with a sheet before walking out. the news of hoover\'s death reaches nixon, and while he does a memorial speech on television for hoover, several members of his staff enter hoover\'s office and proceed to rifle through the cabinets and drawers in search of hoover\'s rumored "personal and confidential" files, but find them all to be empty. in the last scene, helen gandy is seen destroying stacks of files, assumed to be from hoover\'s personal archive.'

(never having understood the concept of time zones, jill thinks she loses hours by travelling west - when actually she gains them.) jill ruins thanksgiving dinner by loudly embarrassing a homeless guest. jack finally calls her out for making a fool of herself, of him, and of everybody else at the table. stung, jill runs off into the woods with her pet [[cockatoo]] poopsie. erin demands that jack apologize to his sister, which he very unwillingly does. jill has a list of things she wants to do while in los angeles: be on a game show (\'\'[[the price is right (u.s. game show)|the price is right]]\'\'), which\xe2\x80\x94despite her horrendous performance\xe2\x80\x94gives jill a carload of prizes simply to be rid of her); go horseback riding (she proves too big and heavy for the pony, which collapses under her); and do a studio tour. since jill has an open-ended plane ticket, she decides to stay until the end of [[hanukkah]] - much to jack\'s horror.jack\'s agency client, meanwhile, wants him to somehow get actor [[al pacino]] to appear in a [[dunkin\' donuts]] commercial. jack isn\'t sure how he\'s supposed to make that happen.jill tries [[online dating]], even though she\'s never known a pc from a calculator. (she even mistakes "[[skype]]" for an [[anti-semitic]] slur!) she has no success until jack poses as jill and alters her profile, leading to more than 100 responses. yet when jill\'s date - "funbucket" ([[norm macdonald]]) - meets her, he sneaks out of the restaurant through the men\'s room.jack takes jill to a [[los angeles lakers|lakers]] game where pacino is supposed to be. pacino (for some reason) blows off jack but is taken with jill. he gives her his phone number (on a hot dog, written in mustard and ketchup). jack was hoping jill would go back home by [[new year\'s eve]], since the family is going on a cruise. jack\'s friends and colleagues throw him a birthday party, extending the invite to jill (jack, for all the right reasons, never let it be known that he even had a sister). again jill loudly disgraces herself, jack, and the various celebrities in attendance...to the point of getting herself forcibly ejected from her own party! pacino invites jill to his home, where she accidentally destroys his [[academy award|oscar]] statuette. abruptly, she becomes bored with him and leaves. jack\'s mexican gardener felipe ([[eugenio derbez]]), who is also taken with jill, invites her to meet his family at their annual fiesta. there she (somehow) hits it off with everybody\xe2\x80\x94and also tries mexican food for the first time, thus acquiring a horrible case of [[diarrhea]] which makes her even tougher to live with than usual.pacino refuses to do the dunkin\' doughnuts commercial unless jack gets him a date with jill; to that end, jack invites jill on the cruise with his family. at sea, while jill continues making a jackass of herself and everyone around her, jack disguises himself as his own sister and goes on her date with pacino. jill suspects that jack invited her on the cruise just so pacino would do the commercial; such is confirmed when she phones jack, he answers as jill, and then she hears pacino in the background. pacino, still believing jack to be jill, spells out that he (pacino) sees much more in her than just a pathetic half-wit...which is what jack always took her for. feeling unspeakably guilty, jack returns to the ship\xe2\x80\x94only to learn that jill has gone back home to [[the bronx]]. at a restaurant on new year\'s eve, toting a picture of her and jack\'s late mother, jill comes across a group of former classmates who always made fun of her; these classmates, led by monica ([[david spade]]), pick up directly where they left off...until jack, his wife and their kids show up. jack and jill converse in their made-up twin language (which even jack finds incomprehensible). then monica attacks erin and is coldcocked by jill. pacino also turns up at the party, dressed as the [[man of la mancha]], and asks jill to marry him. she declines and goes home, where felipe also proposes marriage. being jill, she joyously agrees (read: turns down a wildly-wealthy, successful, and famous actor in favor of a lowly spanish-american gardener who barely made ends meet when he was a bachelor).the television commercial is made, with pacino starring and singing as he promotes a new coffee\xe2\x80\x94"dunkaccino"\xe2\x80\x94with a rap song. but when jack shows it to him, pacino hates it and tells him to destroy every copy of this film. pacino even threatens death to all those who have seen it.'

frustrated with his lack of progress and financial dependence, breaks up with him. later, eddie happens to run into vernon ([[johnny whitworth]]), the estranged brother of eddie\'s ex-wife, melissa ([[anna friel]]). vernon is involved with a shadowy, unidentified pharmaceutical company and gives eddie a sample of a new "smart drug", nzt-48. after taking the pill, eddie finds himself able to learn and analyze information at a superhuman rate. he temporarily has the ability to instantly and meaningfully cross-correlate all of the previously forgotten experiences from his past. but the drug does far more than just raise his i.q. into the 4-digit range. it makes him far more calculating and canny and ambitious as well.the next day, the effects having worn off, eddie seeks out vernon in an attempt to get more. but while eddie is out running errands for him, vernon is murdered. eddie calls the police and then discovers vernon\'s nzt-48 stash just before they arrive. after giving a statement at the precinct, eddie returns home and begins ingesting the drug daily. with the help of the drug\'s amazing effects, eddie spends a few weeks cleaning up his life\xe2\x80\x94finishing his book, getting fit and making friends with a group of young [[jet set|jet-setters]]. they take him on vacation to europe where eddie experiments further with his new-found abilities. testing his analytical skills on the stock market, eddie quickly makes large returns on small investments. realizing he requires more capital, he borrows 100k from a russian loan shark, gennady ([[andrew howard]]), and he quickly parlays this capital into two million dollars plus. he further increases his nzt-48 dosage and begins to rekindle his relationship with lindy.eddie\'s prodigious success leads to a meeting with a finance tycoon, carl van loon ([[robert de niro]]). he tests eddie by seeking advice on a merger with hank atwood\'s ([[richard bekins]]) company. walking through manhattan after the meeting, eddie starts experiencing hallucinations and the sense of time skipping forward, noticing that several hours have suddenly passed of which he has no memory. as this effect recurs over the course of the day and night he finds himself at a nightclub, a hotel party, in a hotel room with a blonde woman ([[caroline winberg]]), and in a subway station where he easily subdues several muggers who attack him (thanks to the effects of nzt-48). when this series of blackouts finally ends, he finds himself standing on the [[brooklyn bridge]] at dawn, 18 hours having passed for which he cannot account. he slowly limps home. later, eddie sees a news report detailing the murder of the blonde woman whom he had presumably slept with, but he is unable to remember whether or not he was the killer.eddie meets with melissa and discovers that she too had been on nzt-48. she informs him that when she attempted to stop taking it, she had experienced a severe mental [[rebound effect]], as well as a limp like eddie, and that there are several people who have died after abruptly quitting. on his way home, eddie is accosted by gennady, who takes eddie\'s last nzt-48 pill. eddie visits lindy and asks her to retrieve his backup stash, which he had hidden in her apartment. on her way back, she is followed by a man ([[tomas arana]]) who\'d been stalking eddie. he corners lindy in a park and kills two unfortunate men who try to protect her. eddie tells her to take one of the pills. this enables her to escape, and she returns the stash to eddie.eddie experiments with the drug and learns to control his dosage, sleep schedule and food intake to prevent side effects. he continues to earn money on the stock exchange and hires bodyguards to protect him from gennady, who threatens him in an attempt to obtain more nzt-48. he buys an armored penthouse and hires a laboratory in an attempt to [[reverse engineer]] the mysterious drug. for his part in carl van loon\'s merger, eddie is promised forty million dollars, and he hires an attorney ([[ned eisenberg]]) to help keep the police from investigating the deaths of both vernon and the woman.on the day of the merger, atwood\'s wife informs van loon that he has fallen into a coma. eddie recognizes atwood\'s driver as his stalker. while eddie participates in a lineup, his attorney steals eddie\'s whole supply of nzt-48 from his jacket. soon afterwards, eddie discovers that his pills are gone and begins to enter [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]].  he also learns that his bodyguards have been killed. but the severe effects of withdrawal cause him to hurry home when van loon questions him about his knowledge relating to atwood\'s coma. gennady breaks into his apartment, demanding more nzt-48. he reveals that to increase the effect\'s potency and duration he has been dissolving it in water and injecting it [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. eddie stabs gennady and licks up some of his pooling blood for the nzt-48 it now contains. his increased mental acuity restored, eddie kills gennady\'s henchmen and escapes. he meets with his stalker, surmising that atwood employed the man to locate more nzt-48. the two join forces and recover eddie\'s stash from his attorney.a year later, eddie has retained his wealth, published a book (entitled \'\'[[the dark fields]]\'\', the name of the book on which the movie is based), and is running for the [[united states senate]]. van loon visits him and reveals that he has absorbed the company that produced nzt-48 and shut down eddie\'s laboratory. he offers a steady supply of the drug in return for power when eddie eventually and inevitably becomes [[president of the united states]]. eddie implies that he has had multiple laboratories working on the drug for the purposes of reverse engineering it, as well as being able to eliminate all of the negative side-effects. he states that he has found a way to wean himself completely off of the drug without losing any of his enhanced abilities. he turns down van loon and sends him on his way. he meets lindy at a chinese restaurant for lunch, where his chinese language skills with the waiter indicate that, whether he still relies on the drug or not, his enhanced abilities are still completely intact.{{cn|date=april 2016}}'

aS"[[oakland athletics]] general manager [[billy beane]] ([[brad pitt]]) is upset by his team's loss to the [[new york yankees]] in the [[2001 american league division series|2001 postseason]], after the yankees overcame a 2\xe2\x80\x930 series deficit. with the impending departure of star players [[johnny damon]], [[jason giambi]], and [[jason isringhausen]] to [[free agency]], beane needs to assemble a competitive team for [[2002 oakland athletics season|2002]], but must overcome oakland's limited payroll. during a visit to the [[cleveland indians]], beane meets [[paul depodesta#moneyball|peter brand]] ([[jonah hill]]), a young yale economics graduate with radical ideas about how to assess players' value. beane tests brand's theory by asking whether he would have drafted him (out of high school), beane having been a major league player before becoming general manager. though scouts considered beane a phenomenal prospect, his career in the major leagues was disappointing. after some prodding, brand admits that he would not have drafted him until the ninth round and surmised that beane would probably have accepted a scholarship to [[stanford]] instead. impressed, beane hires the inexperienced brand to be the athletics assistant general manager.oakland team scouts are first dismissive and then hostile towards brand's non-traditional [[sabermetrics|sabermetric]] approach to scouting players.  most notably, grady fuson (ken medlock) takes to the radio airwaves after being fired by beane and doubts the team's future. rather than relying on the scouts' experience and intuition, brand selects players based almost exclusively on their [[on-base percentage]] (obp). despite vehement objections from the scouts, beane signs the players brand suggests, such as unorthodox [[submarine pitcher]] [[chad bradford]] ([[casey bond]]), past-his-prime outfielder [[david justice]] ([[stephen bishop (actor)|stephen bishop)]] and injured [[scott hatteberg]] ([[chris pratt]]). beane finds that he also faces opposition from [[art howe]] ([[philip seymour hoffman]]), the athletics' manager, who does not agree with the new philosophy. with tensions already high between the two due to a contract dispute, howe disregards beane's and brand's strategy and plays a lineup he prefers. beane eventually trades away the lone traditional first baseman, [[carlos pe\xc3\xb1a]], to force howe to use hatteberg at that position.early in the season, the athletics fare poorly, leading critics to dismiss the new method as a failure. beane convinces the owner to stay the course and the team's record improves. eventually, the athletics win 19 consecutive games, tying for the longest winning streak in american league history. beane's young daughter implores him to go to the a's next game against the [[kansas city royals]], where oakland is already leading 11\xe2\x80\x930 after the third inning and appears set to advance their winning streak to a record-breaking 20. like many baseball players, beane is superstitious and avoids games in progress, but upon hearing how well the game is going on the radio, he decides to go. beane arrives in the fourth inning, only to watch the team go to pieces and eventually allow the royals to even the score at 11. finally, the a's do win, on a [[walk-off home run]] by hatteberg. yet the a's again lose in the postseason, this time to the [[minnesota twins]]. beane is disappointed, believing nothing short of a championship should be considered a success.beane is contacted by the owner of the [[boston red sox]], who realizes that the sabermetric model is the future of baseball. the sox had been one of the earliest subjects of a statistical study.  renowned harvard statistician [[frederick mosteller]] had conducted the first academic investigation of baseball after the sox, whom he loved, lost the 1946 world series.the red sox owner offers beane a job as general manager of the red sox. beane passes up the opportunity, despite the $12.5 million salary, which would have made him the highest-paid [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] in sports history. he returns to oakland to continue managing the athletics, while a title card reveals that two years later the red sox won the [[2004 world series]] using the model pioneered by the athletics."

([[t. j. miller]]), and no longer wishes to continue their relationship or allow him to work at the farm. billy gives ned a ride into town and tells him that if he can scrape together $500, janet might let him stay in the goat barn for rent on the farm. ned stays at his mother\'s house which he is less than enthusiastic about. a few days later, ned shows up at liz\'s house, asking if he can stay with her. he is put in river\'s room and told that he must help around the house and work with dylan on his newest documentary about a russian ballerina named tatiana (lydia haug). the next day, miranda reluctantly asks ned to chauffeur while she interviews an important client, lady arabella ([[janet montgomery]]). miranda hopes to pry into her scandalous past, but is dismayed to learn of a

hours later, ned is told by a police officer to move out of a tow zone. he runs upstairs to get the keys and discovers dylan naked with tatiana. dylan later says the only reason he was naked was to make tatiana feel more "comfortable" while being naked which ned believes. the next night, ned goes with miranda to arabella\'s benefit dinner, and stays behind to have a conversation with arabella. she explains the gossipy part of her life (that miranda had hoped to discover) to ned, who listens with interest. ned is later kicked out of liz\'s house because, at an important school interview, river tells the interviewer that ned just got out of jail for selling drugs to a policeman. ned apologizes, stating he was only trying to help river be himself. now staying with miranda, ned casually mentions dylan\'s nude interview with tatiana and miranda concludes that dylan is having an affair. ned also mentions a personal detail about arabella that makes miranda realize that ned has the info she needs. she forces ned to tell her the details, which ned is ashamed to do since he was trusted. ned returns to the farm with money but is not allowed to rent the barn. ned asks cindy, who is a

aS"a centuries long war between humans and vampires has devastated the planet's surface and led to a [[theocracy]] under an organization called the church.  they constructed giant walled cities to protect mankind and developed a group of elite warriors, the priests, to turn the tide against the vampires. the majority of the vampires were killed, while the remainder were placed in reservations. with the war over, the clergy disbanded the priests. outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of the church.priest is approached by hicks, the sheriff of augustine, a free town. priest learns that his brother and his wife, shannon - priest's girlfriend before he entered the priesthood - were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and priest's niece, lucy, was kidnapped. hicks asks for priest's help in rescuing lucy. priest asks the clergy to reinstate his authority, but church leader monsignor orelas ([[christopher plummer]]) does not believe the vampire story and refuses.  priest defiantly leaves the city and orelas sends three priests and a priestess to bring him back.priest and hicks arrive at nightshade reservation where humans called familiars, people infected with a [[pathogen]] that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires. after a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in sola mira, a vampire hive where priest lost several of his comrades during a major battle. priestess joins them at sola mira, revealing a bond with priest. the trio destroys a hive guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called jericho. the other three priests have arrived at jericho just as night falls and an armored train arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population. the vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat. when the three priests reject black hat's offer to join him, he kills them all.the next morning, priest, priestess and hicks arrive in jericho and discover the town empty and the three dead priests [[crucifixion|crucified]]. priest and priestess share an intimate moment where she makes her move, hoping that now that shannon has died, he would no longer feel bound to her. priest, who is clearly not over shannon, gently refuses. priest realizes that the vampires have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns by night, with the walled cities at the end of the train line. hicks believes an attack on the cities would be unwise because of the sun, but priest reveals that factories, producing [[air pollution|massive clouds of smoke and ash]], have permanently deprived the city of sunlight, so the vampire attack would be a slaughter.hicks threatens priest, claiming he will shoot him unless he promises to let lucy live whether she's been infected or not. (priest had earlier revealed to hicks, who is in love with lucy, that if they discovered lucy had been infected as a familiar, he'd kill her.)  hicks doesn't understand why priest, who is basically a stranger to lucy, cares so much about her. priestess reveals that lucy is actually priest's daughter, and that his brother, owen stepped in as a husband and a father when priest was taken by the church.while priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks, priest and hicks board the train to rescue lucy. battling vampires and familiars, the two are finally overpowered by black hat just as they find lucy. black hat is revealed as one of the priests who was defeated in the final attack on sola mira and a close friend of priest. after being captured, the vampire queen gave him her blood, turning him into the first vampire-human hybrid who can survive the sun. as priest fights black hat, lucy discovers the truth about her parentage. priestess battles several familiars, finally placing the explosives on her motor bike and crashing it into the train engine. the explosion and subsequent derailment kills the vampires and engulfs black hat in fire, while hicks, priest, priestess, and lucy are able to escape.priest returns to the city and confronts monsignor orelas during mass, telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires' bodies. he proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor and shocking everyone in the room. orelas still refuses to believe him, declaring that the war is over. outside the city priest meets priestess and she reveals that the other priests have been notified and will meet them at a rendezvous point. priest sets off into the sunset."

peter separates from them moments before the wolf attacks and murders adrien. however, it is cornered by the men and killed. valerie finds suzette mourning adrien and figures out that he was her love. she also realizes that lucie, being the older daughter, should\'ve been the first to wed and should have been engaged to henry, but could not as she was the illegitimate daughter of adrien, making her henry\'s half sister.the following day, as the people celebrate, father solomon arrives and reveals that, had they killed the wolf, it would have returned to its human form as it is a werewolf, but what they slew was a common [[grey wolf]]. he also reveals that they\'ve entered the blood moon week, an event that happens every thirteen years, in which whoever is bitten by the wolf is cursed to become one as well. father solomon\'s men, led by the captain ([[adrian holmes]]), isolate daggerhorn and begin to investigate its people in search of the wolf. that night, the wolf attacks and, while

vehicle. meanwhile, the boys arrive at the woman\'s trailer. she encourages them to drink, and after being drugged by the beer, they pass out while undressing. jared wakes up while being moved in a covered cage. he realizes he is in the sanctuary at five points after he identifies cooper. cooper begins a long, hate-filled sermon before identifying another captive, a [[homosexual]] they lured in through an internet chat room. they bind him to a cross using plastic cling wrap, execute him with a [[revolver]] and drop him into a small crawl space where travis and billy ray are bound together.cooper then begins binding jared to the cross, but stops when he notices pete driving up to the church. travis and billy ray use a protruding bone from the corpse to cut themselves free, which is heard by caleb ([[ralph garman]]). he lifts up the trap door just in time to see billy ray escape and runs after him. billy ray is not able to help travis out of his tight cling wrap cuffs and leaves him for dead. caleb chases billy ray into a room stocked with weapons, where the two shoot each other. pete hears the gunshots and calls wynan for back-up, but is shot and killed by

caleb, travis (who had broken free) arms himself and plans to shoot the congregation, but witnesses jared still being held captive on the cross. travis makes a run for it, but is mistaken for a congregation member by wynan and shot. keenan tries to reason with the family but a shoot-out erupts instead after atf special agent brooks ([[kevin pollak]]) is shot in the head by cooper. in the midst of the shooting, wynan is killed, and agent keenan receives a call from atf higher-ups ordering him to start a full [[raid (military)|raid]] of the complex to ensure that no witnesses remain.  keenan is clearly disturbed by this, but passes on the order to another tactical agent named harry ([[kevin alejandro]]) who also struggles with this decision and argues with keenan.. keenan dismisses harry\'s protests for personal reasons, rationalizing his decision based on personal gain and the reputation of the atf, and harry storms off in disgust.during the shoot-out, cheyenne ([[kerry

claiming that "the [[rapture]]" has come upon them. abin calmly approaches a stunned atf team and confidently taunts them that god\'s wrath is upon the earth. he raises his arms and stands in the face of a confused and worried keenan in a moment of triumph, daring him to defy god.several days later, during a briefing before high-ranking government officials, keenan reports that he then head-butted cooper and took the rest of the congregation into custody. he explains that the trumpet noises were not the rapture but came from a group of college students who lived down the road and were irritated with cooper. as a prank they rigged up an old fire house siren to an [[ipod]] with loud trumpet noises, unaware of the shootout taking place over the hill. keenan is promoted despite disobeying a direct order from his superiors at the time to kill everyone at the compound.keenan is surprised that he is not punished for his actions but his superiors explain that their initial decision to kill the members of the congregation was mostly personal and that they are satisfied with the alternative punishment of taking away the prisoners\' constitutional rights to [[due process]] by classifying their crimes as terrorism and locking them up without ever letting them go to trial. keenan laments this outcome in a story he shares about a couple of hungry brawling dogs he once knew that taught him about the darker side of human nature and the way simple beliefs can turn humans into bloodthirsty animals.cooper is finally seen pacing around his cell singing and sermonizing to himself until another prisoner ([[kevin smith]]) tells him to "shut the fuck up".===original ending===during various interactive q&as for the film, smith has stated that the original ending actually continued with

aS'seventeen-year-old joshua "josh" mcguire ([[rhys wakefield]]), expedition bank-roller carl hurley ([[ioan gruffudd]]) and his girlfriend, victoria "vic" elaine (alice parkinson), travel to the esa\'ala cave, an underwater [[cave diving|cave exploration]] site in [[papua new guinea]]. josh\'s father, frank ([[richard roxburgh]]), a master diver, has already established a forward base camp at a lower level inside the cave, where the team has been exploring for weeks. as josh voices his disdain for his father and his opinions about cave exploration, the team below prepares to dive into an unexplored area of the system.while exploring the entrance to the new system, judes ([[allison cratchley]]) experiences a problem with her air tank hose. she loses use of her air mask forcing frank to [[buddy breathing|buddy breathe]]. after a few exchanges, judes panics and tries to keep the mask on, but frank forces the mask off of her knowing he will not have enough air otherwise to make it back to the team. as judes drowns, josh watches on a monitor at "forward camp" and presumes the worst of his father. in a struggle to determine who truly was responsible for her death, it is revealed by frank that judes had dived in an exhausted state since they previously had to retrieve the extra bailout tanks, a task josh didn\'t do. meanwhile, their above-ground crew realizes that a very big storm is preparing to hit their location sooner than anticipated. they attempt to warn the team below, but are unsuccessful. josh expresses his desire to return to the surface and with communications down and an uncertain expedition in front of them, team leader frank agrees to have his son return to the surface with a buddy climber ahead of them.while josh climbs back towards the surface with luko, liz, and j.d, water begins rushing in from their exit. the storm they were trying to avoid had turned into a [[cyclone]] causing flash floods that begin to fill the cave. as j.d. and liz make their way up through "the elevator" (an area leading up to the main entrance of the cave), josh is unable to leave his father and the dive team behind to their doom and turns back, accompanied by luko. as they are making their way back to "forward camp" they discover that frank and the team have already evacuated their camp and are assisting victoria as she climbs her way up and out of the cavern. josh leaps in to help, strapping a rope around a nearby boulder and forming a belay for the team to escape.  unfortunately, the boulder begins to give way leaving josh to hold victoria\'s line and luko to hold back the boulder. the water rushes through and forces victoria and josh to fall back down into the now flooded base camp. luko is severely injured when the boulder breaks loose, sealing the shaft and throwing him back down into the cavern. he is swept into an underwater tunnel before the team can reach him. the team decides to use the unexplored tunnel as an escape route from the rapidly flooding cavern. victoria, panicked and anxious, refuses to wear jude\'s old wetsuit and is given a quick tutorial on how to dive. before the team can leave, a severely injured and mutilated luko surfaces in the cavern. seeing that his friend is in great pain and near death, frank mercifully [[euthanasia|drowns him]].the team presses on and makes it through to the other side of the system. without a wetsuit, victoria suffers severely from the cold water. meanwhile, george an experienced, veteran diver has become ill due to the dive and is dying unbeknownst to the rest of the team. after a short rest, the team continues through the system following the flow of water out towards the sea. george realizes that he cannot continue and after sharing a few words with josh relieves himself of his pack and hides himself so as not to burden the rest of the team.as the team marches on they arrive at a seemingly dead end. a great hole in the bottom of the cave separates them from the other side of their path. josh uses his climbing expertise to fish a line across and begins to transfer their gear and each other. as victoria begins to make her way across she catches her hair in her rope gear she is hung on and loses her grip, leaving her hair as the only thing holding her weight. using her knife, she attempts to cut away the hair, but severs her rope and falls to her death. at the sight of victoria\'s death, carl becomes psychotic. in a fit of panic, he steals the last remaining rebreather and disappears into the tunnel. josh and frank, however, find another way out through a crevasse in the cavern. the tunnel leads them to a sunlit cavern where an unidentified wwii [[japanese tanks of world war ii|japanese tank]] collapsed through the surface years ago. unfortunately the hole in the middle of the roof where the tank fell is the only opening and they are unable to climb out. they spend the rest of the day there and proceed back into the cave by night.a little later they discover carl who has gone completely insane and found victoria\'s corpse. carl attempts to murder frank but josh separates the two and temporarily disables carl. frank, however, has been gravely injured having fallen on a [[stalagmite]] which punctured his back. when carl wakes, the gravity of his actions is realized and he solemnly disappears into the tunnel. in immense pain, frank requests that josh drown him. josh reluctantly does so, and swims into the tunnel. a short distance in, he encounters carl, who has already drowned looking for the exit. just as he begins to lose hope, josh discovers a way out through the cave to open ocean. he emerges from the water and crawls onto the beach, where he is discovered by fishermen.the end credit paid a tribute to

twins rebecca ([[rowan blanchard]]) and cecil ([[mason cook]]). and after giving birth to a daughter, maria, she decides to retire, in order to keep her family out of danger and prevent them from learning about her former career. however, the twins observe that wilbur\'s work leaves him little time to spend with them, and rebecca in particular does not accept marissa as a replacement for her deceased mother, and delights in playing pranks on her. attempting to strengthen her rapport with rebecca, marissa gives her a red-sapphire necklace that she says her own parents gave her when she was rebecca\'s age, and which she says will protect her in her darkest hour.the media reports that time is speeding up at an increasing rate. a masked criminal mastermind calling himself the time keeper (also played by jeremy piven), who is allied with an escaped tick tock, claims responsibility for the phenomena, saying that he will unleash project: armageddon, as punishment upon a society he believes wastes time with meaningless pursuits instead of treasuring time with one\'s loved ones. the time keeper demands that tick tock bring him the chronos sapphire, the only thing that can stop it, which is revealed to be the jewel in the necklace marissa gave rebecca. the oss calls marissa back out of retirement and instructs her to bring the chronos sapphire with her. when marissa requests it from rebecca, it further strains their relationship, and when marissa arrives at oss headquarters with maria, she discovers that the box rebecca gave her did not contain the jewel.before marissa

henchman and go to oss headquarters, where marissa\'s niece and their step-cousin, carmen cortez ([[alexa vega]]), gives the twins a tour of the now defunct spy kids division, and the weapons its juvenile agents once used. carmen lets the twins each pick out one deactivated gadget as a souvenir.as marissa pursues tick tock with maria in tow, rebecca and cecil decide to go after the time

spite. the twins confront danger d\'amo over the fact that his watch is similar to the one worn by the time keeper, and the fact that his name is an anagram of "armageddon." he confirms that he is the time keeper, and imprisons them. when a group of oss agents led by marissa, carmen and juni return to the clock shop to confront the time keeper, he freezes the agents in time using circuity in their id badges that he can control with his watch, and does the same on a more massive scale to 18 major cities around the globe. juni, however, whose badge was thrown away by carmen, is still free, and manages to free marissa and carmen.danger reveals to the twins that his father was the head of the wells experiment and that he was the boy frozen in time. his father spent the remainder of his life trying unsuccessfully to set him free. the oss managed to shut down the experiment with the chronos sapphire, which fell to earth as a meteorite. in doing this they freed the boy, but he was now a man in a boy\'s body, and his loved ones were all now dead. now danger plans to use the armageddon device in go back in time in order to be reunited with his father. cecil, however, tells danger that attempts at time travel merely create multiple versions of oneself. cecil deduces that danger has already tried this unsuccessfully before multiple times, and that each time he comes back, he comes back worse, pointing out that tick tock and his now-unmasked minions are all versions of danger himself. cecil says that persisting in trying to change the past will only cause armageddon, and rebecca, who sympathizes with danger\'s bereavement, tells him that it is important that he use what time he has wisely, instead of trying to acquire more of it. when danger\'s time vortex opens, he steps through it, and meets his father in the past, but then returns an elderly man, and realizes that cecil was right, as he could not change anything. he shuts down the device and tick tock is apprehended by wilbur, who shows up and is reunited with marissa and the children. carmen and juni announce that they will co-lead a revived spy kids program, while rebecca and cecil go on to become

amber ([[jamie chung]]), blondie ([[vanessa hudgens]]), rocket ([[jena malone]]), and rocket\'s sister and "star of the show", sweet pea ([[abbie cornish]]). dr. gorski is envisioned as the girls\' dance instructor. blue informs babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the high roller ([[jon hamm]]), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. gorski encourages babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which babydoll further fantasizes she is in [[feudal japan]], meeting the wise man ([[scott glenn]]). after she expresses her desire to "escape", the wise man presents babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require "a deep sacrifice" but bring a "perfect victory". she then fights three samurai giants. as her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance having impressed blue and other onlookers.babydoll convinces the four girls to join her in preparing an escape. she plans to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. during her dances, she imagines fantastic adventures that mirror the escape efforts. these adventures include infiltrating a bunker protected by [[steampunk]]-inspired [[world war i]] german soldiers to gain a map (mirrored by sweet pea copying a map of the brothel/institution from blue\'s office); storming an [[orc]]-infested castle to retrieve two fire-producing crystals from inside a baby dragon (mirrored by amber stealing a lighter from the mayor\'s pocket); and boarding a train and fighting robotic guards to disarm a bomb (mirrored by sweet pea stealing a kitchen knife from the cook\'s belt). during the last fantasy, rocket sacrifices herself to save sweet pea and is killed when the bomb detonates, which is paralleled by the cook fatally stabbing rocket while she tries to protect her sister.blue overhears blondie relaying babydoll\'s plan to gorski, confirming his suspicions that something is amiss. he has sweet pea locked in a utility closet and confronts the other girls backstage. he shoots amber and blondie and attempts to rape babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his master key. babydoll frees sweet pea and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while they look for an exit. they escape into the courtyard, where they find a throng of men blocking their way. babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact her own sacrifice. she concludes that this is actually sweet pea\'s story. despite sweet pea\'s protests, she insists on revealing herself to the visitors, thus distracting them long enough to allow her friend to slip away unnoticed.back in the asylum, the surgeon has just performed babydoll\'s lobotomy. the surgeon is baffled by babydoll\'s expression, and asks gorski why she authorized the procedure. gorski realizes that blue has forged her signature and summons the police, who apprehend blue as he attempts to sexually assault a lobotomized babydoll. while being led away, blue also incriminates the stepfather. babydoll is shown smiling serenely, having apparently found freedom within her own inner "paradise", with dr. gorski noting earlier that the girl, during her short stay, stabbed an orderly, started a fire, and helped another girl escape the asylum.at a bus station, sweet pea is stopped by police as she tries to get on a bus to [[fort wayne, indiana|fort wayne]], but she is rescued by the bus driver (the wise man), who misleads the police and allows her to board. sweet pea thanks the driver, who tells her they have "a long way to go".during the end credits, dr. gorski and blue perform "[[love is the drug]]" in a glitzy musical sequence that includes all five female leads.'

aS'short-order cook frank darbo ([[rainn wilson]]) says in [[voice-over]] that he has only two good memories from a disappointing life: marrying his beautiful wife, sarah ([[liv tyler]]), and an incident in which he directed a police officer to catch a purse snatcher. frank immortalizes these two events in a pair of crayon drawings that he hangs on his wall for inspiration.later, sarah, a recovering addict, leaves frank for jacques ([[kevin bacon]]), a charismatic strip club owner who gets her hooked on drugs. frank sinks into depression, where he has a vision in which he is touched by the finger of god ([[rob zombie]]) and meets the holy avenger ([[nathan fillion]]), a superhero from a [[public-access television]] show on the all-jesus network, who tells frank that god has chosen him for a very special purpose. frank believes that god has chosen him to become a superhero and goes to a local comic book store for inspiration. his claim that he is designing a new superhero is met with enthusiastic appreciation from the foul-mouthed store clerk, libby ([[ellen page]]). frank creates a superhero costume and assumes the identity of "the crimson bolt."armed primarily with a pipe wrench, he begins to fight crime by delivering savage beatings to various rulebreakers, ranging from [[illegal drug trade|drug dealers]] and [[child sexual abuse|child molesters]] to a man who cuts in line at the movies. the crimson bolt soon becomes a media sensation. initially, the media view him as a violent [[psychopathy|psychopath]], but he begins to gain public appreciation after the criminal backgrounds of many of his victims come to light. frank later attempts to rescue sarah, but jacques\' thugs recognize him under the costume and shoot him in the leg as he flees.a wounded frank goes to libby for help, as his home is no longer safe with jacques\'s thugs looking for him. libby cajoles frank into letting her become the crimson bolt\'s "kid sidekick," christening herself "boltie" and designing a sexually suggestive costume. she proves to be even more unhinged than frank, using her superhero guise to almost kill a man who may or may not have [[vandalism|vandalized]] her friend\'s car. frank decides to let her go, but changes his mind when libby rescues him from some of jacques\' thugs at a gas station. libby soon becomes enamored with frank, but her advances are turned down as frank insists that he is still married. arguing that it is different when they are in their superhero identities, libby [[rapes]]  frank while the two are in costume. frank runs to the bathroom and vomits, where he encounters a vision of sarah in the toilet. he decides that it is time to rescue her from jacques.armed with guns, pipe bombs, and bulletproof vests, frank and libby sneak into jacques\' ranch, killing the first few guards they encounter. however, they are both eventually shot. frank is struck in the chest, his bulletproof vest sparing him, but libby is shot in the head and killed. devastated by her death, frank goes into a rage, brutally slaughtering all of jacques\' thugs, despite their pleas for mercy. inside, he has a final showdown with jacques, where jacques shoots frank and wounds him, but frank gains the upper hand and, after delivering a final [[monologue]], he stabs jacques to death as sarah watches, horrified.frank then takes her home, and she stays for a few months before leaving him again. this time, however, she manages to finally overcome her addiction and uses her experiences to help others with similar problems. she remarries and has four children. this makes frank realize that sarah, not him, was the chosen one, because if frank and libby hadn\'t gone to jacques\' ranch that night, her children would never have been born. frank is convinced that her children will change the world for the better.frank, now with a pet bunny, looks on his wall of happy memories. the wall is covered with pictures of his experiences from his time spent with libby and pictures of sarah\'s kids, who call him "uncle frank." frank looks at libby\'s picture, and a tear runs down his cheek.'

military attempts to kill the alien. martin is injured in an explosion, so charles stays behind with him while joe and cary head to the cemetery, where joe had earlier seen something there that made him suspicious. inside the cemetery\'s garage, they find a massive tunnel leading to a warren of underground caverns. in a chamber beneath the town\'s water tower, they find the alien has created a device from the town\'s stolen electronics, that it appears to be trying to fully activate, attached to the base of the tower. the alien also has several people, including alice, hanging from the ceiling and unconscious, that it uses for food. using cary\'s firecrackers as a distraction, joe frees alice and the others, but they end up trapped in a dead end cavern after the alien chases them down and eats the others. alice and cary scream and cower against the tunnel wall, but joe steps forward and tries to talk to the alien. the alien grabs joe, who quietly speaks to the alien, telling him over and over that "bad things happen" but that the alien "can still live". after studying joe for a moment, and then hearing its device fully activating, the alien releases him and departs, allowing the three to return to the surface.as joe and alice reunite with their fathers, everyone watches as various metal objects from all over town are magnetically pulled to the top of the water

aS'the film is set in [[1988 in the united states|1988]] [[los angeles]]. matt franklin ([[topher grace]]) is a recent [[massachusetts institute of technology|mit]] graduate who works at a [[suncoast video]] store while trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, something that his police officer father ([[michael biehn]]) has grown impatient with. while working one day, matt\'s high school crush, tori frederking ([[teresa palmer]]), randomly walks into the store. after pretending that he doesn\'t work there and saying that he works at [[goldman sachs]] in an effort to impress her, tori invites matt to a [[labor day]] party, hosted by matt\'s twin sister wendy\'s ([[anna faris]]) boyfriend, kyle masterson ([[chris pratt]]), at his hillside home.later that night, matt, wendy, and matt\'s best friend, barry nathan ([[dan fogler]]), head to the party. on the drive over, barry steals a brand new [[mercedes-benz]] convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress tori. the trio arrive at the party. while there, matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at goldman sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo tori. barry snorts some [[cocaine]] he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and wendy\'s boyfriend [[marriage proposal|proposes]] to her in front of everyone at the party. she says yes, upsetting matt, who doesn\'t think that kyle will support her in her dream to attend [[graduate school]] at the [[university of cambridge]]. tori eventually invites matt and barry to another party her boss is hosting in [[beverly hills]]. matt takes tori there in the mercedes, while barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while matt and tori continue to mingle with each other, after matt\'s successful \'put down\' of tori\'s boss, a habitual sexual harasser. they leave the party to go into a neighbor\'s backyard where they jump on a [[trampoline]], play [[truth or dare]], and end up having sex.meanwhile, wendy shares her unopened admissions letter from cambridge with kyle, and it is revealed that she was not accepted. kyle is visibly relieved, while wendy is visibly upset. matt confesses to tori that he doesn\'t actually work at goldman sachs. tori gets extremely upset at his deception and storms off, back to her boss\'s party, leaving matt guilt-ridden. matt finds barry there and they leave the party, and matt tells barry about how he told tori the truth about his job. barry patronizes him for not trying to have just one night of enjoyment and attempts to lighten the mood by offering matt a line of cocaine, despite him driving. matt, feeling vulnerable, attempts to snort the cocaine, but ends up driving the convertible off the road and into a ditch. a police cruiser soon arrives, and it turns out to be matt\'s dad and his police partner. already disappointed with matt\'s unwillingness to choose a career path, mr. franklin damages the convertible even more as a means of coercing matt to get a better job in order to pay off the damages. he takes matt and barry into custody, but lets them off in the neighborhood with a warning. matt apologizes to his dad for being such a failure, to which his dad replies that because he\'s never even tried to succeed, he\'s actually less than a failure. then, in a less condescending tone, he encourages matt to take a shot at anything in life.knowing tori has left her car at the party, matt and barry make their way back there, where bets are being placed on who will "ride the ball", a giant, steel sphere that someone enters and rides as it\'s rolled down a hill (something matt\'s dad has stated that nobody has done since he himself was a kid). matt finds tori at the party and tries to apologize, but tori is unwilling to forgive him. feeling he has nothing to lose, matt volunteers to "ride the ball". when he does the ball rolls downhill uncontrollably, hitting several parked cars and eventually flying off an embankment before landing in a backyard swimming pool. matt almost drowns as the ball sinks, but manages to escape just in time. barry rushes to the scene and walks with matt back toward the party, meeting up with wendy and tori, who are elated to discover he wasn\'t killed. matt apologies to tori, and she forgives him after playing a little hard-to-get and then gives him her phone number. all four return to the party, which is beginning to wind down as dawn approaches. all who are still there \'whoop\' it up at matt\'s successful return.wendy, after realizing matt was right all along, ends the [[engagement]] and breaks up with kyle, who experiences a crying breakdown. pondering his future with a goth-type girl he met at the party, barry is told by her that maybe he should go to college. outside, as she leaves the party, matt boldly kisses tori goodbye. matt\'s dad is shown investigating the scene where the steel ball was found. he finds matt\'s suncoast video name tag floating in the pool, and smirks proudly. barry staggers out of the party house, now in a shambles, to meet up with wendy and matt, who asks "who wants breakfast?", and the three leave together as the sun is rising.'

aS'in [[lagrange, ohio]], curtis laforche ([[michael shannon]]) has apocalyptic dreams, and visual and auditory hallucinations, of rain "like fresh motor oil", swarms of menacing black birds, and being harmed by people close to him; but, he hides all of this from his wife, samantha ([[jessica chastain]]), and their deaf daughter hannah (tova stewart). he instead channels his anxieties into a compulsive obsession to build a storm shelter in his backyard; however, his increasingly strange behavior -- including a tendency to cut ties with anyone in his life that has harmed him only in his dreams -- strains his relationship with his family, friends, employer, and the close-knit town. curtis grudgingly sees a counselor at a free clinic, with whom he talks about his family\'s psychological history (his mother ([[kathy baker]]) suffers from [[paranoid schizophrenia]] that surfaced in her at about the same age that curtis is now).in order to get the expanded storm shelter done, curtis breaks work rules by using equipment (e.g., a [[backhoe]]) from his construction job at his house, and gets a home improvement loan he can ill afford to start building the shelter -- all without telling his wife. "sam" becomes angry when she discovers the project. after curtis takes more than the prescribed dose of a sedative and suffers a seizure, sam calls an ambulance. he recovers, then finally explains the truth to her, including his dreams.curtis begins to miss more work, causing tensions with his boss, as he and sam make preparations for the [[cochlear implant]] surgery hannah is to undergo in six weeks\' time. having been informed of the borrowed work equipment, curtis\'s boss fires him at the house and gives him only two weeks\' worth of medical insurance benefits, after placing dewart ([[shea whigham]]), the close friend and co-worker whom curtis asked to help him start construction of the shelter, on two weeks\' unpaid administrative leave.curtis buys gas masks for his family, and extends his previous employer\'s health insurance policy for a few extra weeks. finding that his counselor at the free clinic has suddenly transferred and been replaced with a new one, he walks out. tensions linger between curtis and sam over his loss of a job/income at such a crucial time for their family. sam gets curtis to see an actual psychiatrist, and demands that they attend a social function, so she can restore some sense of normalcy to their strained, increasingly isolated life. at a lions club community gathering, a bitter dewart (who has been spreading a whispering campaign about curtis being crazy) angrily provokes and punches curtis. curtis loses his temper and unleashes an frightening verbal tirade upon everyone at the lions club dinner. he prophetically shouts that a devastating storm is coming, insisting that none of them are prepared. later, a tornado warning sends him and his family into the shelter. after they awaken, curtis reluctantly removes his gas mask, prompted by samantha. they go to open the shelter doors, but he still hears a storm outside. his wife implores him, insisting that there\'s no storm and that he needs to open the door. after a tense standoff, curtis throws open the doors into the blinding sun; a strong-but-bearable storm has passed, and neighbors are cleaning up broken tree limbs and other yard debris as power company trucks restore electricity along the street.a psychiatrist advises the couple to go through with their planned, annual beach vacation; but that curtis will need to get psychiatric care in a facility -- away from his family -- upon their return. at [[myrtle beach, south carolina|myrtle beach]], while curtis is building sand castles with hannah, she signs the word "storm". as samantha exits their beachhouse, the thick, oily rain that curtis spoke of begins to fall, staining her outstretched hand. sam looks up to a bigger version of the ominous storm clouds curtis had seen, massing over the ocean; tornado-like waterspouts reach down to the ocean\'s surface, and the tide pulls back as a  [[tsunami]] looms in the distance. curtis and sam exchange knowing glances.'

aS'{{plot|date=may 2016}}in 1982, an alien spacecraft is discovered beneath the antarctic ice by a team from a norwegian research base: edvard ([[trond espen seim]]), jonas ([[kristofer hivju]]), olav (jan gunnar r\xc3\xb8ise), karl (carsten bj\xc3\xb8rnlund), juliette (kim bubbs), lars ([[j\xc3\xb8rgen langhelle]]), henrik (jo adrian haavind), colin (jonathan lloyd walker), and peder ([[stig henrik hoff]]). [[columbia university]] [[paleontologist]] kate lloyd ([[mary elizabeth winstead]]) is recruited by dr. sander halvorson ([[ulrich thomsen]]) and his assistant adam finch ([[eric christian olsen]]) to investigate the discovery.they travel to the norwegian base, thule station, located in antarctica near [[the thing (1982 film)#production|u.s. outpost 31]], in a helicopter manned by carter ([[joel edgerton]]), derek ([[adewale akinnuoye-agbaje]]), and griggs ([[paul braunstein]]). after viewing the spacecraft, kate, sander, and adam are told the group also discovered an alien body from the crash, buried in the ice nearby. in the afternoon the body is brought to the base in a block of ice.that evening, while the team celebrates their find, derek sees the alien burst from the ice and escape the building. the team searches for the creature and discovers that it killed lars\' dog. olav and henrik find the alien, which then grabs and engulfs henrik. the rest of the group arrive and set fire to the creature, killing it. an autopsy of the scorched alien corpse reveals that its cells were consuming and imitating henrik\'s own.derek, carter, griggs and a sick olav take the helicopter to seek help. kate discovers bloody [[dental restoration|dental fillings]] near a blood-soaked shower. she runs outside to flag down the helicopter after it takes off. when it attempts to land, griggs transforms into the thing and attacks olav, causing the helicopter to spin out of control and crash in the mountains. when kate returns to the shower, she finds the blood is gone.the team decides to send a party to the closest base, but kate confronts them with her theory that the thing can imitate them and has likely already done so. they dismiss her claims, but juliette says she saw colin leaving the showers. juliette and kate look for the vehicle keys to prevent the others from leaving, when suddenly juliette transforms and tries to attack kate. as kate flees, she runs past karl, who is impaled by the creature instead. lars arrives with a [[flamethrower]] and burns the juliette-thing, and then the thing already assimilated karl.that night evard, kate and lars find carter and derek stumbling into base, half frozen. the team refuses to believe that they could have survived the crash. kate has them [[quarantine|isolated]] until a test can be prepared to verify they are human. adam and sander had started to work on a test, but the lab is set on fire in the few minutes it\'s left unattended. kate proposes another test, believing that the thing cannot imitate inorganic material. she inspects everyone and singles out those without [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] dental fillings: sander, edvard, adam, and colin.lars and jonas go to retrieve carter and derek for testing, and discover they have broken out. as lars searches a nearby building, he is suddenly pulled inside. the group hears carter and derek breaking into the building and rushes to intercept them. in the middle of a standoff, edvard orders peder to burn them. peder takes aim, but derek fires off several shots with lars\'s gun, killing peder and puncturing the flamethrower\'s fuel tank, which ignites seconds later. the explosion knocks edvard unconscious.when brought to the rec room, edvard transforms, [[infecting]] jonas and derek before assimilating adam. kate torches the infected jonas and derek before she and carter pursue the thing. while the pair searches, sander is also infected. they get separated and the thing, into which edvard and adam are now fused, corners carter in the kitchen. kate burns it as it sprints toward carter, causing it to run straight through the wall and crash into the snow, dead. they see sander drive off into the blizzard and pursue him in the remaining [[snowcat]].they arrive at the spacecraft, where it suddenly activates and its engines begin to melt the ice over it. kate falls into the ship and is separated from carter. kate discovers the source of the radio transmission at the beginning of the film, in the form of a giant glowing cylinder with strange geometric blocks forming and shifting apart, the signal still broadcasting. confronted by the creature, kate destroys it with a thermite grenade and the explosion deactivates the ship, shutting down its engines. kate and carter escape the ship and carter suggests driving to a soviet base about fifty miles away, saying that they\'d stashed enough fuel in their snowcat to be just able to cover that distance.as kate and carter return to their vehicle, kate notices something strange. she accuses carter of being the "thing" because he\'s missing his earring. when she confronts him, carter points to the wrong ear. kate then burns him, during which he screams like the alien, proving kate\'s deduction correct. she then retreats to sanders\' snowcat and stares blankly as the [[dissolve (filmmaking)|screen fades black]].as the final credits roll, helicopter pilot matias arrives by morning at the now destroyed norwegian outpost. he shouts, looking for any survivors. colin is shown to have committed suicide in the radio room using a straight razor to slash both his arms and throat to ensure the thing could never get to him. matias sees the charred remains of the adam/edvard-thing in the snow.lars, now revealed to be alive and uninfected, orders matias at gunpoint to show his dental fillings to prove that he is human. the thing, in the form of lars\' (deceased) dog, then runs out of the camp. lars realizes it\'s the thing and orders matias to start the helicopter. as the dog runs away from thule station, the two chase it in the norwegian helicopter, with matias piloting and lars leaning out of the open doorway, trying to shoot it with a scoped rifle

aS"in [[venice]] at the beginning of the 17th century, the three [[musketeer#musketeers_in_france|musketeers]], [[athos (fictional character)|athos]] ([[matthew macfadyen]]), [[porthos]] ([[ray stevenson (actor)|ray stevenson]]), and [[aramis]] ([[luke evans (actor)|luke evans]]), with the help of athos' longtime lover, [[milady de winter]] ([[milla jovovich]]), steal airship blueprints made by [[leonardo da vinci]]. however, they are betrayed by milady, who gives the blueprints to the [[george villiers, 1st duke of buckingham|duke of buckingham]] ([[orlando bloom]]). upon returning to france, the musketeers are forced to disband by [[cardinal richelieu]] ([[christoph waltz]]) for their failure, and they end up on the streets of paris.a year later, a young man named d'artagnan ([[logan lerman]]) leaves his village in [[gascony]] for paris in hopes of becoming a musketeer as his father was, only to learn that they no longer exist. at a rural bar, d'artagnan accuses [[comte de rochefort|captain rochefort]] ([[mads mikkelsen]]), the leader of richelieu's guard, of offending his horse, and challenges him to a duel. rochefort shoots him while he is distracted but he is saved by milady de winter. arriving in paris, d'artagnan by coincidence separately encounters athos, porthos and aramis accidentally offending all three, then scheduling duels with each at 12:00, 1:00 and 2:00&nbsp;pm respectively.athos brings porthos and aramis to the duel as his seconds. d'artagnan realises they are the musketeers he is seeking. he is prepared to continue with the duel but richelieu's guards break it up. the three are inspired by d'artagnan and fight together and defeat the soldiers, but later are summoned before the young [[louis xiii of france|king louis xiii]] ([[freddie fox (actor)|freddie fox]]) and his wife, [[anne of austria|queen anne]] ([[juno temple]]). richelieu asks the king to execute the four, but the queen is impressed by their bravery and the king congratulates them and invites them to an event, which to athos' anger, turns out to be buckingham's arrival (who comes in an airship built following da vinci's blueprints).later, richelieu orders milady, who is actually working for him, to plant false love letters among queen anne's possessions, steal queen anne's diamond necklace, and take it to the [[tower of london]] to frame queen anne as having an affair with the duke of buckingham. the affair would force king louis to execute queen anne and declare war on england. at this point, the people would demand a more experienced leader: richelieu himself. but milady demands that richelieu declare in writing that she is working on behalf of france, to protect herself in case of palace intrigue.the false letters (saying that the necklace has been given to buckingham) are found by a maid and are given to king louis, who is advised by richelieu to set up a ball at which queen anne would be forced to wear the necklace. if she doesn't, then her affair is real, and there will be war against [[kingdom of england|england]]. queen anne's [[lady-in-waiting]] constance bonacieux ([[gabriella wilde]]) discovers richelieu's plan and asks the musketeers to stop him. the musketeers plan to sail to england and retrieve the jewels before the ball. however, at the dock, rochefort sets up a blockade to prevent anybody from boarding the ships. constance takes d'artagnan's hat, cape and horse to divert the guards standing in front of the boat to allow the musketeers to board undetected.in london, milady warns buckingham that the musketeers have arrived to take revenge on him. milady instructs buckingham of all their tendencies in battle, but athos predicts this and the musketeers resolve to do just the opposite. buckingham captures d'artagnan, but he was a decoy to let the musketeers steal the airship. the musketeers rescue d'artagnan, demolishing the top floor of the tower in the process. athos was sure that milady would have fled, taking the necklace with her as insurance, so he planted the musketeers' manservant planchet ([[james corden]]) as her carriage driver to take her to an isolated spot where the airship could pick up the carriage. as retribution for betraying them, athos prepares to execute milady. however, milady leaps off the airship before athos can shoot, apparently dying on her own terms.the musketeers fly back to paris with the necklace, but they are attacked by rochefort in another airship, as milady had given richelieu copies of da vinci's blueprints. rochefort then reveals that he has constance, and threatens to kill her if they don't hand over the necklace. d'artagnan agrees to exchange the necklace for constance, with whom he is infatuated, but rochefort knocks him out and captures him as soon as the necklace is in his possession. rochefort then proceeds to attack the musketeers' ship, at first gaining the upper hand due to the superior size and weaponry of his airship. however, the musketeers lure rochefort into a storm cloud, burst the balloon of the airship and make the ship crash onto the notre dame cathedral. on the roof, d'artagnan duels and stabs rochefort, who falls to his death. meanwhile, constance returns the necklace to queen anne.the musketeers arrive at the ball in buckingham's damaged airship. however, for the sake of king louis and his people, they claim that richelieu had it built for the king, but an attempt was made by rochefort to sabotage it, also showing king louis the authorization richelieu had given milady, pretending that it was given to them. the king then congratulates the musketeers, and thanks d'artagnan, who he sees as his best friend, for everything. richelieu, impressed by how the musketeers handled the situation, offers them places in his employ, but they refuse. richelieu threatens them by saying they will one day regret their choices, but they laugh him off. as louis and anne dance, d'artagnan and constance kiss. the musketeers then leave, promising that they will protect france as musketeers when they are needed.at sea, milady (who survived her fall) is rescued by buckingham, who reveals that he knows that she was working for richelieu and says that he is going to fight against france. the camera backs away and shows buckingham advancing towards france's shore with a massive fleet of battleships and airships."

aS'the film opens with fast-talking businessman and [[diamond]] dealer kyle miller ([[nicolas cage]]) speaking to a client over the phone as he returns to his lavish [[mansion]] home, his wife sarah ([[nicole kidman]]) and his teenage daughter avery ([[liana liberato]]). despite the [[superficial charm|charming facade]], it is immediately clear that the family is dysfunctional and emotionally distant: avery disrespects her parents and, despite being forbidden to do so, sneaks out of the house to go to a party with her friend kendra. sarah appears bored with life as a housewife and yearns for more in her marriage while kyle seems to harbor a hidden aversion towards his wife. just as kyle is about to leave for a business transaction, the house is suddenly invaded by a gang of robbers masquerading as police.the thieves, consisting of leader elias ([[ben mendelsohn]]), his [[stripper]] girlfriend petal ([[jordana spiro]]), his younger brother jonah ([[cam gigandet]]), and a large intimidating man named ty ([[dash mihok]]), tell kyle and sarah that they have been spying on them for some time and are aware of the large amounts of cash and diamonds hidden in their home. they command kyle to open a safe hidden in the wall but, despite the threat of a [[syringe]] containing [[lethal injection]] chemicals, he defiantly refuses, believing that he and sarah will be killed if he simply gives in to their demands. sarah, meanwhile, recognizes jonah through his mask. through a series of jonah\'s flashbacks and a conversation with elias, it is strongly implied that sarah and jonah had a previous affair when the latter was employed as a technician to install the house\'s security system. unbeknownst to elias, sarah secretly steals the syringe from him during this conversation.having left her party in disgust (after the host jake clumsily attempted to seduce her), avery returns home and, after a brief chase, is also captured and taken to her parents. elias appeals to kyle, claiming that he needs money to pay for a [[kidney transplantation]] for his dying mother and that, if kyle refuses to comply, he will instead take one of avery\'s kidneys. sarah catches elias off-guard and holds him hostage with the syringe. forced into a [[mexican standoff]], the thieves compromise by letting avery escape in exchange for kyle opening the safe. he does so, revealing it to be completely empty. kyle explains that he is actually bankrupt and has no money; his house and all of his possessions were bought on loaned credit. enraged, elias breaks kyle\'s hand and instead demands material compensation by taking sarah\'s prized diamond necklace. however, kyle reveals that this too is a fake [[cubic zirconia]] replica and is completely worthless. ty recaptures avery from outside and brings her back into the house. kyle volunteers for his own kidney to be taken instead of his daughter\'s, but elias reveals that it was a ploy and that he hated his mother, who is already dead. ty grows impatient after receiving a phone call and commands elias to hurry up; kyle realizes that the burglars are themselves being coerced into committing the heist against their will.the thieves then separate the miller family, with kyle and avery being tied up and guarded in the living room and sarah being pursued by jonah in the kitchen. jonah states to sarah that he still loves her and promises that she and avery will be left unhurt. meanwhile, kyle uses a lighter to burn both his own and avery\'s binds; they attempt an escape and set off the house\'s security system. kyle ends up in a struggle with ty, and, despite ty\'s superior strength and fighting skills, kyle manages to inject a portion of the syringe chemicals into his arm, causing him to fall unconscious.thinking that ty is dead, elias shoots kyle in the leg and reveals his true motives: that he is a [[drug trafficking|drug dealer]] working for an organized crime syndicate. shortly after being given a job to sell $180,000 worth of [[cocaine]], elias and petal were carjacked at gunpoint and all of their shipments were promptly stolen. faced with threats of retribution, elias was then forced to commit a heist (under the supervision of henchman ty) to pay off his debt. jonah, who had previously seen the miller residence, suggested it as a place to rob.avery attempts to run out of the house again but is caught by jonah. under the threat of her parents being killed, she is forced to answer a call from the security company and successfully convinces them to call off the police. however, a security guard shows up nevertheless, with sarah ordered to make him leave, but the security guard catches sight of jonah and recognises him as a colleague, prompting jonah to shoot him in the head.kyle reveals to elias that the only thing of any worth on him is his [[life insurance]]. desperate and out of options, elias kicks kyle down and prepares to kill him. at the last second, avery remembers the money she saw at the earlier party and pleads with the thieves that she can help them steal it from the party if they spare her father\'s life. elias reluctantly agrees to the proposition and sends petal to supervise avery as she drives to the party house and ensure that she keeps her word (during a conversation between elias and petal it\'s revealed their daughter was taken into care). although avery\'s initial idea is to seduce jake and then steal his money, she is horrified when petal begins to deliriously proclaim that she plans to massacre all of the party guests and then take the cash. seeing a swerving road ahead, avery accelerates the car, unbuckles petal\'s seat belt, and intentionally crashes into a telephone pole, incapacitating petal and allowing avery to handcuff petal to the steering wheel.back at the miller home, sarah learns that kyle had discovered a picture of her kissing jonah from security footage and was suspicious for some time that she had been unfaithful. sarah, however, insists that she is innocent and only loves kyle: the same flashback is now shown from her perspective, revealing that jonah is in fact [[mental illness|mentally ill]] (and off his medications) and that the supposed love affair between him and sarah was all in his head. the "kiss" had occurred to sarah\'s complete surprise and against her will. at this point, ty reawakens from his stupor and attacks sarah. enraged, jonah tackles ty and the two fight. just as ty is about to strangle jonah to death, elias shoots him in the back for trying to kill his brother. however, in his dying breath, ty reveals to elias that he had been set up all along: the "robbers" stealing his cocaine shipment were actually fellow members of the same crime organization and the operation was done in order to [[blackmail]] him into stealing more money for them. more damningly, ty also claims that jonah had masterminded the entire plan so he could have an excuse to return to the miller residence and profess his love to sarah. elias is shocked by the allegations but refuses to believe them (though doubt about his brother does seem to creep in.)through the chaos, sarah and a wounded kyle escape to the tool shed behind the house and are pursued by elias and jonah. after a brief fight, the thieves break through a partition in their tussling  and to their surprise discover a large amount of money that\'s been hidden in the shed;
